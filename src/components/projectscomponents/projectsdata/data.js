                    "The brief for Canal Plaza was to design a commercially viable office building on a green field site, located at the northern end of Heron Close, Century City, a vibrant urban centre just outside Cape Town. The development is the latest of several we have previously delivered in the area. Designed for Abland Property Developers, it is a 10,816m² commercial office development. The five-storey structure comprises offices and retail units, with basement and podium car parking.",
                    "The development overlooks the serene Intaka Island, an award-winning 16-hectare wetland and bird sanctuary that hosts 177 species of indigenous fynbos plants and 120 bird species. The position adjacent to the wetland reserve of Intaka Island makes the location an attractive one for commercial tenants.",
                    "The accommodation in the five-storey structure is arranged in an H-shaped plan with a central core. The wings of the “H” splay to the south to reflect the geometry of the site and to receive visitors from Heron Close. The western wing is partially elevated from the ground to form an understorey for visitor parking and to allow for visual and pedestrian permeability. Here, a small retail component has been integrated to service office workers and pedestrians passing on the north-south route along the canal edge.",
                    "The planning and servicing of the commercial office space has been strategically designed to be adaptable and versatile. This means its floorplates can accommodate several tenants of various sizes. This flexibility will support the development’s long-term economic sustainability, as the space can respond to the dynamic workplace needs of future tenants. Accessible external terraces have been provided on the west and eastern edges of the site. Provision has been made on the roof for access to amenities and photovoltaic panels.",
                    "The building is designed to minimise energy use and enhance thermal comfort with the goal of achieving a Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA) 4-star rating as a minimum. It is a welcome addition to the Century City precinct, which has in recent years been transformed into a sophisticated hub, attracting a cross-section of local and international investors, global corporates, residents and visitors. It’s one of several buildings we’ve designed in Century City. Visit the others at Sable Park, Bridge Park, Axis, Sable Corner and Canal Walk."

It is a true gateway development, with its unique sculptural form and striking staggered wraparound façade. The mix of executive suites, in one-, two- and three-bedroom apartment configurations, along with penthouses and duplex apartments on upper levels, enable smaller lock-up-and-go living, or full-time immersion in an executive environment to suit individual needs. Apartment layouts can be adapted to the diverse needs of buyers, and the location offers easy access to public transport and a vibrant neighbourhood.",

The challenge was to design a building of dramatic presence in a prominent position without detracting from future neighbouring developments, while also balancing the need to acknowledge Mont Choisy’s layered heritage.",

Cantilevered apartment overhangs provide shade over the ground-floor retail, while sliding shutters and fixed screens improve energy efficiency. Interiors designed by dhk Interior Design combine luxury with lifestyle, marking a sophisticated contribution to Mont Choisy's vision."

                    "The brief by Tricolt for Brookfield at Royal was to conceptualise a luxurious residential experience that bridges the gap between the past and present. The result is a high-end estate that represents the true value of sophisticated design in urban housing. When complete by the end of 2025, the development will feature around 290 units estate in one-, two-and three-bedroom configurations, starting from 38m2 up to 154m2penthouses.",
                    "Brookfield at Royal in Johannesburg is the first luxury apartment development to be situated within the precinct of the Royal Johannesburg and Kensington Golf Club. The development is set out on a long, narrow, sloping site alongside the golf course, arranged in a linear form that follows the contours of the land. Each block consists of three-storey walk-up structures, typically arranged in clusters of six to eight units. Each cluster features a symmetrical layout with two-bedroom apartments on the ground and first floors, and loft units on the top floor with bedrooms and living spaces split between two levels.",
                    "The design is characterised by a central pitched frame flanked by flat-roofed sections. This combination creates an undulating rhythm along the length of the development. The pitched roofs are clad in slate-grey standing-seam steel roof sheets, while the flanking sections feature red brick and white-painted plaster. These vertical roof elements play a key role in the terraced design form.",
                    "Open gables on one side house entrances and vertical circulation, with balconies facing on to landscaped parking. Gables on the other side feature expansive glazing and steel-and-glass balconies overlooking the golf course, with vertical brick barbecue columns forming privacy dividers between units. Each unit is crowned by twin steel chimney pipes, forming an iconic leitmotif throughout the scheme.",
                    "The combination of traditional materials of red brick and plaster and modern elements of steel and glass creates a harmonious blend of solidity and lightness that references the treed landscape between the buildings, private gardens, a dam and golf course. The dark steel and slate-grey tones reference the original black slate roof of the Royal Johannesburg clubhouse. The overall effect is a carefully articulated contemporary interpretation of a traditional terraced row-house development.",
                    "The Royal Johannesburg and Kensington Golf Club was established in 1890. It is recognised as one of the premium golf courses in Africa. The long-established club is regarded as the “home of golf” in South Africa. It hosts the Gauteng Senior Golfer’s Society, the PGA of South Africa and the Club Managers Association of South Africa. Brookfield at Royal is one of several developments we designed for Tricolt. Click to see more details about Olympus Sandton, One Rosebank, Ellipse Waterfall and Tree Tops, Houghton."

The building is located on the northern portion of the park, which extends down to the reception lobby and porte cochere at street level. This residential project kickstarts the second phase of the masterplan designed to enliven the Canal Precinct into a mixed-use environment where retail outlets, offices and a hotel already exist.",

This is achieved by stepping back the building footprint in certain areas and through the façade articulation. Recessed balconies featuring frameless glazed balustrades are fronted by a large shaped brise-soleil outer façade to provide solar shading. This also avoids the building becoming an overbearing mass.",

                    "Designed for Tricolt and Attacq, Ellipse Waterfall is located in the heart of Waterfall City, in Gauteng. The client brief was to create a unique residential complex of striking architectural impact to mark its status as the first high-rise luxury apartment development in the area",
                    "In response, we moved away from the traditional rectangular apartment block design in favour of a more unconventional form. We proposed four separate elliptical towers to make the most of the site’s elevated location and unobstructed views. The buildings' shape takes inspiration from an ellipse, a mathematical term for a curved plane surrounding two focal points, which is highly efficient in terms of ratio of surface area to internal volume. The lack of corners reduces the visual profile of the buildings to offer the most suitable form when considering multiple towers in proximity to one another.",
                    "The 45 000 m² precinct features 620 apartments, including executive one-bedroom, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom units and multiple penthouse suites. Other amenities include The Luna Club, an exclusive multi-concept lifestyle destination.",
                    "The towers sit on a raised podium, creating an elevated ground floor with a parking garage and services infrastructure underneath. The podium level is extensively landscaped and includes a central piazza, running track, active and passive parks, lap and leisure pools, verdant gardens and The Luna Club. These spaces offer moments of connection between residents and encourage community activity. At street level, an elevated forecourt addresses the most prominent corner where retail spaces spill out onto the activated street edges to create a relationship with other users from the broader Waterfall City community.",
                    "The four towers have an identical footprint, though each is a different height. Newton has 10 storeys, Kepler has 11 storeys, Cassini has 13 and Galileo 15. The curvilinear façade of the towers is complemented by a mix of moveable and fixed screens which serve to animate the elevations. This produces an ever-changing collage responding to the movement of the sun and the moods of its occupants.",
                    "The interiors have a clean and contemporary aesthetic, complete with ultra-modern finishes, high ceilings and large windows that provide panoramic views of the Gauteng skyline. Designed with user experience in mind, everything has been considered to optimise internal functionality and flow. Ellipse’s design prioritises sustainable living. It incorporates green design practices and building features that contribute to a reduced environmental footprint.",
                    "Inspired by their mathematical origins, each tower is named after some of the world’s most celebrated scientists, namely Newton, Kepler, Cassini and Galileo. This is one of multiple projects we have delivered for Tricolt. Visit One Rosebank, Brookfield at Royal and Olympus Sandton for more details."

The client, Tricolt, envisaged a luxury residential development located close to the vibrant commercial hub of Rosebank, located north of the Johannesburg CBD.",
                    "We responded with a design that contributes to the urban design language of the adjacent Oxford Parks precinct. The 1.2-hectare site is bordered by large commercial office buildings to the south and single residential homes on large, tree-lined plots to the north.",
                    "The design responds to the site’s sloping topography, resulting in a seven-storey block to one side of the site and a lower, four-storey construction opposite, respecting the zoning requirements and acknowledging the scale of the surrounding urban fabric. These buildings encompass around 600 units in studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom configurations, designed around a large landscaped courtyard that creates an active social environment containing a gym, swimming pool and ball court. Mixed-used elements include co-working spaces, a coffee shop with meeting rooms and a spectacular rooftop restaurant and a bar",
                    "The architecture is simple and fresh, comprising a strong, two-storey tiled and colonnaded lower base, with upper levels of white-painted, raked, jointed brickwork. An alternating rhythm of inset balconies and windows are offset with projecting concrete framed bays. This forms a carefully modulated and taut composition, creating varying depths of light and shadow. Simple vertical steel balustrades further animate and enliven the façades. Walkway bridges and strong vertical breaks between blocks define entrances, the position of lobbies and vertical circulation. The retail components, gym and clubhouse are expressed as lightweight flat-roofed, steel and glass pavilions, with a publicly accessible terrace stitching the building sat the corner. The rooftop restaurant follows the same transparent architectural formula, with its angled shopfronts and corner tilted roof capturing the panoramic views above the dense tree canopy of the urban forest below.",
                    "One Rosebank is one of a series of projects we have worked on in Rosebank. In 2016, we designed the masterplan for Oxford Parks, drawing from the concepts laid out in the Dunkeld Design Manual which we developed in 2015. We also designed several other buildings in the precinct including 203 Oxford, 6 Parks Boulevard for Arup and Radisson Red hotel, which have both been recognized in local awards series."

This central feature not only provides a unifying element but also serves as a green corridor for leisure and recreation.",

A hierarchy of streets and spaces defines the community, with a primary circular route at its core. Secondary roads branch off from this main artery, creating intimate residential pockets and fostering a village-like atmosphere. Phase 1 of the project commenced in February 2024."

                    "The new multimedia academic learning centre at Bishops Diocesan College in Rondebosch, Cape Town, was completed in 2024. The design combines the expertise of our architecture team and interior design team at dhk Interior Design. The project comprises the transformation of a cluster of existing different rooms and functions which previously adjoined the library into a multimedia-based learning hub in the heart of the academic precinct. The existing facility had become outdated and needed to be better connected to surrounding buildings, movement routes and the landscape. The key requirement was to expand the learning environment, with built-in flexibility to configure the spaces as needs arise.",
                    "The result is a contemporary insertion, as a hub surrounded by a mix of building styles, some historical and others more modern. Extensive glazing at the ground floor creates a virtual wall that enables a sense of openness and connection to the surrounding gardens and buildings despite the tightness of the location. It also allows for a direct relationship to a terraced outdoor space which can be used as a spill out area for gatherings or outdoor learning. Both existing walls which have been preserved and those that are new feature deep, angled reveals and chamfered, shaped windowsills. Long narrow windows create an effective, playful aesthetic impact, while also helping to control light hitting the east and west façades.",
                    "Internally, the space can be sub-divided to accommodate flexible learning configurations. The accommodation is arranged around a spindle, with staffrooms on the upper levels that upgrade staff facilities to a more multi-functional environment. These rooms feature easily accessible booths, meeting pods and breakaway rooms. A new Information and Communications Technology (ICT) centre is accessed from this area too, providing a permanent, dedicated ICT centre to staff and learners alike. This crucial hub provides services to teachers and administrators, and also learners, so ease of access and security were of equal importance.",
                    "The interiors by dhk Interior Design are configured as a calm backdrop against to stimulate learning and development. The interiors are designed deliberately to not mimic design trends or use design gimmicks; rather, the aesthetic treatment reflects the ethos and longevity of the campus, by honouring the Bishops brand identity with a complementary colour palette. The interior design follows a visual thread expressing all elements of the building’s architecture.
