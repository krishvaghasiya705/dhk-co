                    "The brief for Canal Plaza was to design a commercially viable office building on a green field site, located at the northern end of Heron Close, Century City, a vibrant urban centre just outside Cape Town. The development is the latest of several we have previously delivered in the area. Designed for Abland Property Developers, it is a 10,816m² commercial office development. The five-storey structure comprises offices and retail units, with basement and podium car parking.",
                    "The development overlooks the serene Intaka Island, an award-winning 16-hectare wetland and bird sanctuary that hosts 177 species of indigenous fynbos plants and 120 bird species. The position adjacent to the wetland reserve of Intaka Island makes the location an attractive one for commercial tenants.",
                    "The accommodation in the five-storey structure is arranged in an H-shaped plan with a central core. The wings of the “H” splay to the south to reflect the geometry of the site and to receive visitors from Heron Close. The western wing is partially elevated from the ground to form an understorey for visitor parking and to allow for visual and pedestrian permeability. Here, a small retail component has been integrated to service office workers and pedestrians passing on the north-south route along the canal edge.",
                    "The planning and servicing of the commercial office space has been strategically designed to be adaptable and versatile. This means its floorplates can accommodate several tenants of various sizes. This flexibility will support the development’s long-term economic sustainability, as the space can respond to the dynamic workplace needs of future tenants. Accessible external terraces have been provided on the west and eastern edges of the site. Provision has been made on the roof for access to amenities and photovoltaic panels.",
                    "The building is designed to minimise energy use and enhance thermal comfort with the goal of achieving a Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA) 4-star rating as a minimum. It is a welcome addition to the Century City precinct, which has in recent years been transformed into a sophisticated hub, attracting a cross-section of local and international investors, global corporates, residents and visitors. It’s one of several buildings we’ve designed in Century City. Visit the others at Sable Park, Bridge Park, Axis, Sable Corner and Canal Walk."

The clients sought to create a development that emphasises high comfort standards, expressing the pinnacle of luxury living while contributing to Sandton’s urban landscape.",
                    "The scheme was conceived as an elevated experience. The development features alternating curved geometric floorplates, resulting in a visually dynamic silhouette on the city’s skyline. It is a true gateway development, with its unique sculptural form and striking staggered wraparound façade. The mix of executive suites, in one-, two- and three-bedroom apartment configurations, along with penthouses and duplex apartments on upper levels, enable smaller lock-up-and-go living, or full-time immersion in an executive environment to suit individual needs. Apartment layouts can be adapted to the diverse needs of buyers, and the location offers easy access to public transport and a vibrant neighbourhood.",

A grand sculptural staircase connects the building with high-end retail amenities at the street-level entrance.

The clients also needed a compelling vision for the interiors of The Paradigm.",

The building’s distinctive façades on Buitengracht, Longmarket, Shortmarket and Rose Streets each have a unique character that respond to the facing context. On Buitengracht, the building reflects the tall buildings along Buitengracht and the CBD skyline to the east, while the building steps down in response to the lower-scale of Rose Street.",

New retail stores and restaurants line this new space, offering moments of connection, a chance to linger and a place for visitors and residents to meet and greet. Secure parking, swimming pool, and rooftop lounge offers residents a chance to live, work and play in inner-city Cape Town style.",

The result is a high-end estate that represents the true value of sophisticated design in urban housing. When complete by the end of 2025, the development will feature around 290 units estate in one-, two-and three-bedroom configurations, starting from 38m2 up to 154m2penthouses.",
                    "Brookfield at Royal in Johannesburg is the first luxury apartment development to be situated within the precinct of the Royal Johannesburg and Kensington Golf Club. The development is set out on a long, narrow, sloping site alongside the golf course, arranged in a linear form that follows the contours of the land. Each block consists of three-storey walk-up structures, typically arranged in clusters of six to eight units. Each cluster features a symmetrical layout with two-bedroom apartments on the ground and first floors, and loft units on the top floor with bedrooms and living spaces split between two levels.",
                    "The design is characterised by a central pitched frame flanked by flat-roofed sections. This combination creates an undulating rhythm along the length of the development. The pitched roofs are clad in slate-grey standing-seam steel roof sheets, while the flanking sections feature red brick and white-painted plaster. These vertical roof elements play a key role in the terraced design form.",
                    "Open gables on one side house entrances and vertical circulation, with balconies facing on to landscaped parking. Gables on the other side feature expansive glazing and steel-and-glass balconies overlooking the golf course, with vertical brick barbecue columns forming privacy dividers between units. Each unit is crowned by twin steel chimney pipes, forming an iconic leitmotif throughout the scheme.",
                    "The combination of traditional materials of red brick and plaster and modern elements of steel and glass creates a harmonious blend of solidity and lightness that references the treed landscape between the buildings, private gardens, a dam and golf course. The dark steel and slate-grey tones reference the original black slate roof of the Royal Johannesburg clubhouse. The overall effect is a carefully articulated contemporary interpretation of a traditional terraced row-house development.",
                    "The Royal Johannesburg and Kensington Golf Club was established in 1890. It is recognised as one of the premium golf courses in Africa. The long-established club is regarded as the “home of golf” in South Africa. It hosts the Gauteng Senior Golfer’s Society, the PGA of South Africa and the Club Managers Association of South Africa. Brookfield at Royal is one of several developments we designed for Tricolt. Click to see more details about Olympus Sandton, One Rosebank, Ellipse Waterfall and Tree Tops, Houghton."

The building is located on the northern portion of the park, which extends down to the reception lobby and porte cochere at street level. This residential project kickstarts the second phase of the masterplan designed to enliven the Canal Precinct into a mixed-use environment where retail outlets, offices and a hotel already exist.",

This is achieved by stepping back the building footprint in certain areas and through the façade articulation. Recessed balconies featuring frameless glazed balustrades are fronted by a large shaped brise-soleil outer façade to provide solar shading. This also avoids the building becoming an overbearing mass.",

                    "Designed for Tricolt and Attacq, Ellipse Waterfall is located in the heart of Waterfall City, in Gauteng. The client brief was to create a unique residential complex of striking architectural impact to mark its status as the first high-rise luxury apartment development in the area",
                    "In response, we moved away from the traditional rectangular apartment block design in favour of a more unconventional form. We proposed four separate elliptical towers to make the most of the site’s elevated location and unobstructed views. The buildings' shape takes inspiration from an ellipse, a mathematical term for a curved plane surrounding two focal points, which is highly efficient in terms of ratio of surface area to internal volume. The lack of corners reduces the visual profile of the buildings to offer the most suitable form when considering multiple towers in proximity to one another.",
                    "The 45 000 m² precinct features 620 apartments, including executive one-bedroom, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom units and multiple penthouse suites. Other amenities include The Luna Club, an exclusive multi-concept lifestyle destination.",
                    "The towers sit on a raised podium, creating an elevated ground floor with a parking garage and services infrastructure underneath. The podium level is extensively landscaped and includes a central piazza, running track, active and passive parks, lap and leisure pools, verdant gardens and The Luna Club. These spaces offer moments of connection between residents and encourage community activity. At street level, an elevated forecourt addresses the most prominent corner where retail spaces spill out onto the activated street edges to create a relationship with other users from the broader Waterfall City community.",
                    "The four towers have an identical footprint, though each is a different height. Newton has 10 storeys, Kepler has 11 storeys, Cassini has 13 and Galileo 15. The curvilinear façade of the towers is complemented by a mix of moveable and fixed screens which serve to animate the elevations. This produces an ever-changing collage responding to the movement of the sun and the moods of its occupants.",
                    "The interiors have a clean and contemporary aesthetic, complete with ultra-modern finishes, high ceilings and large windows that provide panoramic views of the Gauteng skyline. Designed with user experience in mind, everything has been considered to optimise internal functionality and flow. Ellipse’s design prioritises sustainable living. It incorporates green design practices and building features that contribute to a reduced environmental footprint.",
                    "Inspired by their mathematical origins, each tower is named after some of the world’s most celebrated scientists, namely Newton, Kepler, Cassini and Galileo. This is one of multiple projects we have delivered for Tricolt. Visit One Rosebank, Brookfield at Royal and Olympus Sandton for more details."

                    "The design responds to the site’s sloping topography, resulting in a seven-storey block to one side of the site and a lower, four-storey construction opposite, respecting the zoning requirements and acknowledging the scale of the surrounding urban fabric. These buildings encompass around 600 units in studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom configurations, designed around a large landscaped courtyard that creates an active social environment containing a gym, swimming pool and ball court. Mixed-used elements include co-working spaces, a coffee shop with meeting rooms and a spectacular rooftop restaurant and a bar",
                    "The architecture is simple and fresh, comprising a strong, two-storey tiled and colonnaded lower base, with upper levels of white-painted, raked, jointed brickwork. An alternating rhythm of inset balconies and windows are offset with projecting concrete framed bays. This forms a carefully modulated and taut composition, creating varying depths of light and shadow. Simple vertical steel balustrades further animate and enliven the façades. Walkway bridges and strong vertical breaks between blocks define entrances, the position of lobbies and vertical circulation. The retail components, gym and clubhouse are expressed as lightweight flat-roofed, steel and glass pavilions, with a publicly accessible terrace stitching the building sat the corner. The rooftop restaurant follows the same transparent architectural formula, with its angled shopfronts and corner tilted roof capturing the panoramic views above the dense tree canopy of the urban forest below.",
                    "One Rosebank is one of a series of projects we have worked on in Rosebank. In 2016, we designed the masterplan for Oxford Parks, drawing from the concepts laid out in the Dunkeld Design Manual which we developed in 2015. We also designed several other buildings in the precinct including 203 Oxford, 6 Parks Boulevard for Arup and Radisson Red hotel, which have both been recognized in local awards series."

                    "The new multimedia academic learning centre at Bishops Diocesan College in Rondebosch, Cape Town, was completed in 2024. The design combines the expertise of our architecture team and interior design team at dhk Interior Design. The project comprises the transformation of a cluster of existing different rooms and functions which previously adjoined the library into a multimedia-based learning hub in the heart of the academic precinct. The existing facility had become outdated and needed to be better connected to surrounding buildings, movement routes and the landscape. The key requirement was to expand the learning environment, with built-in flexibility to configure the spaces as needs arise.",
                    "The result is a contemporary insertion, as a hub surrounded by a mix of building styles, some historical and others more modern. Extensive glazing at the ground floor creates a virtual wall that enables a sense of openness and connection to the surrounding gardens and buildings despite the tightness of the location. It also allows for a direct relationship to a terraced outdoor space which can be used as a spill out area for gatherings or outdoor learning. Both existing walls which have been preserved and those that are new feature deep, angled reveals and chamfered, shaped windowsills. Long narrow windows create an effective, playful aesthetic impact, while also helping to control light hitting the east and west façades.",
                    "Internally, the space can be sub-divided to accommodate flexible learning configurations. The accommodation is arranged around a spindle, with staffrooms on the upper levels that upgrade staff facilities to a more multi-functional environment. These rooms feature easily accessible booths, meeting pods and breakaway rooms. A new Information and Communications Technology (ICT) centre is accessed from this area too, providing a permanent, dedicated ICT centre to staff and learners alike. This crucial hub provides services to teachers and administrators, and also learners, so ease of access and security were of equal importance.",
                    "The interiors by dhk Interior Design are configured as a calm backdrop against to stimulate learning and development. The interiors are designed deliberately to not mimic design trends or use design gimmicks; rather, the aesthetic treatment reflects the ethos and longevity of the campus, by honouring the Bishops brand identity with a complementary colour palette. The interior design follows a visual thread expressing all elements of the building’s architecture. Materials are robust and durable, but natural timbers make the space warm and inviting, while concrete and steel reflect the exterior language. The furniture selection prioritises flexibility, with pull-out ottomans, multipurpose and multifunctional furniture and shelving that can be configured to respond to learning needs.",
                    "The Bishops Learning Centre represents an example of how existing buildings can be reused, preserving their historical personality while facilitating 21st Century learning."

                    "The Longkloof Precinct project was a complex multidisciplinary adaptive reuse design challenge that creates a meaningful dialogue between heritage and contemporary elements in a sensitive and respectful combination. The 15-year long project comprises the sensitive restoration of five historic buildings and the construction of a new five-star hotel, set within an interconnected landscaped public realm with new street frontage and a new secured yet publicly accessible external space at the heart of the precinct.",
                    "The site comprises six separate erven owned by a single owner, with an accumulated site area of 16,500m2, in a transitional location off the edge of the Cape Town CBD. Five original historic buildings of various scales were subject to heritage protections in terms of height, building mass, protected view corridors, façade articulation and materiality. The precinct was landlocked with minimal street frontages and restricted public access to commercial buildings; it had become fragmented, lacking spatial cohesion and connectivity.",
                    "The project commenced in 2010, with the original architectural brief to design an office, retail and basement parking proposal on the larger site which included existing surface parking. While this site contained one of the historical buildings, only one wall of that building was deemed worthy of retention. The brief later expanded to individual redevelopment proposals for the other heritage buildings in the precinct. It became clear that there was a need, and an opportunity, to fully integrate all the erven into one cohesive precinct. The precinct-wide urban design approach creates a vibrant publicly accessible environment while respecting heritage indicators and the surrounding context.",
                    "The scheme revitalises the existing heritage buildings, upgrading them to premium grade co-working and office spaces. Contemporary additions included additions and partial demolition to existing buildings, excavations to activate existing basement floors and to create activated courtyard spaces, reconfiguring internal spaces into open-plan offices and reinstating ground floor connections between existing buildings and the public realm. The new-build five-star hotel was initially designed and approved as two separate office buildings. This approved scheme was later adapted to hotel use, which required above-ground connection between the two buildings with glass-clad bridges at all four levels. Façades are stepped back away from the street to reduce their scale and to better respond to the surrounding streetscape and the public square. New ground floor retail, restaurants and cafes enliven street edges, pedestrian walkways and new urban square.",
                    "The design introduces new pedestrian links into and through the precinct to connect the surrounding public realm into the heart of the new Longkloof precinct. This enhances the quality of the public realm and emphasises pedestrian permeability. Street edges and pedestrian routes are well defined, with canopies or pergolas offering protection in appropriate areas. Access to three levels of basement parking ensures a car-free pedestrian-friendly environment. On site vehicular movement is limited to hotel drop off and intermittent servicing along Jamieson Lane."

                    "The Rubik is a 27-storey mixed-use tower designed for Abland Property Developers. The developers wanted a viable yet unique design for a modern mixed-use building on an 821m2 site that straddles the historical inner-city district and the more recently developed city blocks north of Riebeek Street in Cape Town’s CBD. The design needed to address the challenge of its location in a Heritage Overlay Zone and required approval from heritage authorities. The result is a distinctive form that rises to 91 meters. While exceeding initial height restrictions, the resulting approval led to a building that enhances the city skyline with its dynamic sculptural elegance.",
                    "Retail spaces activate the streetscape from ground to first floor and the parking podium rises ten floors above. The upper levels, from floors 11 to 26, are divided into three stacked,orthogonal twisting cubes rotated around a central axis. These levels contain commercial offices and residential apartments, including one- and two-bedroom units, duplex and triplex penthouses. The fragmentation creates visual interest and captures varied reflections of the surrounding cityscape. Small recessed terraces punctuate the facade, adding to the building’s aesthetic.",
                    "The façade design is thoughtful and contextual. The parking podium’s exterior references the scale and rhythm of nearby heritage buildings, using a combination of pre-cast concrete, extruded aluminium, and glazed panels. The office and residential levels feature flush glazing co structural elements and incorporates discreet balconies.",
                    "Despite the tight site constraints, the internal layout maximises efficiency. The centralised lift core and scissor stair accommodate parking circulation below while providing flexibility for office and residential layouts above. Terraces to the residential units are stepped back, providing protection from the weather. A common roof terrace with a pool and indigenous planting crowns the building.",
                    "The Rubik incorporates several sustainable features including high-performance glazing, energy-efficient systems and environmentally-friendly materials. Its mixed-use nature and central location promote urban density and walkability, aligning with sustainable urban development principles. Overall, The Rubik stands as a significant contemporary addition to Cape Town’s skyline, balancing modern design with sensitivity to its historic context while promoting a vibrant, mixed-use urban environment."

                    "35 Lower Long is an elegant and dynamic tower designed for Abland Property Developers and Ellerine Brothers in Cape Town’s Foreshore precinct. It features14 floors of office space, flexible co-working spaces, a luxurious top-floor business suite, ground-floor retail space and 280 parking bays.",
                    "The site contained an existing, unremarkable 1980s building. The initial brief was to remodel and extend that building. However, this proposition was deemed impractical due to the limitations of adding floors, the need to replace an outdated façade and challenges with long-term viability. The scheme was subsequently revised to create a significantly taller, more inspirational structure that would enhance Cape Town’s skyline and offer developers greater medium- to long-term viability. That said, the challenge remained to maximise the quality of multi-tenant commercial space while accommodating core components such as lifts, stairs and structured basement parking, all within a relatively small floor plate.",
                    "The result is a building characterised by a singular sculpted massing with dynamic glazed façades that extend seamlessly over the office’s floors and parking levels. The façade terminates above ground level to emphasise and activate the street edge, particularly along entire length of the street frontage along Lower Long and Jetty Streets. This is enlivened by retail units at ground level, multiple entry points to the office building and a prominent double-volume main entrance.",
                    "The two main corners of the building are chamfered towards the roof line, breaking the solidity of the building. The glazing on these corners soars upwards past the roofline, further articulating the façade and extending past the building’s chamfered corners, giving the effect of a crystalline screen rather than solid building mass. The sculptural form of the building provides dynamic views from across the city, both at street level and from nearby buildings. 35 Lower Long was designed according to best practice green principles and holds a 4-Star Green Star rating by the Green Building Council of South Africa.",

The brief from Intaprop for Radisson RED Rosebank was to create an architecturally sophisticated hotel with a playful tone. Oxford Parks emerged from the Dunkeld Design Manual, an urban masterplan which we developed to harness the strengths of Rosebank’s walkable urban realm and to connect the centre with others beyond. Key characteristics of the masterplan are human-scale architecture with striking façades and active street frontages. Radisson RED delivers on both points.",
                    "The hotel comprises 222 keys, a restaurant, bar and rooftop terrace and a generous reception area accessible from the pedestrian hub of Oxford Parks. The grand full-height entrance canopy creates a striking sense of place, highlighted with public artworks and halo pendant lights. Ground-floor volumes are visually transparent to increase internal/external interaction, reinforced by interior spaces that spill over into undercover outdoor seating areas. Illumination at night magnifies the visual impact",
                    "Art is a key feature. Bold red accents and sculptural red artworks reference the RED brand. A commissioned angel-wing sculpture by local artist Usha Seejarim forms a prominent landmark. Corridors, rooms and suites feature custom-designed wallpaper inspired by local people, art, music and fashion. Street-style art displays change regularly. An interactive digi-wall and Chromecast televisions offer high-tech visuals. The building adheres to ASHRAE standards for high thermal comfort. Its energy-efficient fittings also surpass SANS 10400 standards."

The key objective for this approach was to design buildings that were efficient while making an architectural statement that could reflect and embody the existing heritage context.",
                    "The development prioritises occupant well-being through optimised living and workspaces, improved indoor air quality and the use of non-toxic materials throughout. This focus on health and comfort contributes to an enhanced quality of life for residents and workers throughout the development. A timber brise-soleil creates an elegant screen that enhances privacy for the apartments on the upper floors.",
                    "The central courtyard at the heart of the development is one of its most striking features. Cobblestones and cascading planted terraces provide a tranquil retreat from urban life, beyond the surrounding busy streets. Ground floor retail and commercial units open directly into the courtyard, enhancing it as an active public space. Secure underground parking, access control and separate entrances to the residential units contribute to the sense of privacy for residents. Overall, our design response has resulted in a development that seamlessly blends historical charm with modern sophistication, offering a unique living and working experience.",
                    "We were also very proud to secure the ground floor space to locate our Cape Town office, providing us with a prominent street presence and a direct connection with the urban environment. In February 2025, Old Cape Quarter was awarded a Four Star Greenstar As-Built Rating by the Green Building Council of South Africa, recognising its sustainable design principles."

                    "6 Parks Boulevard, for Intaprop, formed part of the first phase of the new Oxford Parks precinct in Johannesburg. Our brief was to design a striking headquarters building within the new commercial development. At just three storeys, and with only a portion of the façade facing Oxford Road, the design needed to be unique and eye-catching to make an impression on passing foot and vehicle traffic. Arup, a multidisciplinary planning, design and advisory consultancy, was the primary tenant at completion, occupying the 1 300m² office space.",
                    "Our solution was to establish a distinctive façade of fritted glass featuring a pattern of trees inspired by Johannesburg’s urban forest, reflecting Arup’s focus on sustainable development. We applied a specific focus on the contrast between light and dark frames surrounding the glazed area, creating interest and maintaining focus and energy on the façade.",
                    "The Oxford Parks urban design framework emerged from our 2015 project to develop the Dunkeld Design Manual. This was conceived to extend the vibrant, pedestrian environment of Rosebank along the Oxford Road corridor and link it to the emerging retail and office node of Illovo. We have also completed two other buildings in the precinct – Radisson RED and 203 Oxford, and another, One Rosebank, will be completed in 2025. We also created the entire basement and podium to prioritise a pedestrian friendly precinct environment at Oxford Parks."

                    "The head office of Capitec Bank is one of the jewels in our portfolio. This building is a great example of how innovative commercial office design can drive operational efficiencies and can also be cost effective. Located in Stellenbosch in the Western Cape, the building is named iKhaya, meaning ‘home’ in isiXhosa. Capitec is one of the largest and most progressive banks in Africa.",
                    "The brief emerged from Capitec’s strategic business decision to move into custom-designed, owned buildings that would better serve its business requirements. One of the key priorities in the brief was creating a head office that would be true to the brand and facilitate high interaction between business units and the executive team.",
                    "Our response was to create a striking, almost other-worldly building that uses effective exterior and interior design to optimise internal flow, foster inter-departmental interactions, manage corporate expenditure and enhance sustainability. The three-storey curvilinear building is defined by its dynamic interior architecture, which embodies the company’s progressive outlook and facilitates agile working",
                    "Completed in 2020, the three-storey superstructure wraps around itself, into a unique ‘doughnut’ shape. A central triple volume atrium acts as an internal social spine at the heart of the building. Internally, wide open-plan floorplates loop around the atrium’s periphery. This is an intentional design element to better connect the various departments, creating opportunities for chance collaborative encounters and personal interactions.",
                    "Our clients championed environmental sustainability and employee well-being throughout the building. To future-proof the design of the building, a flexible and agile approach was taken. Various breakaway areas offer spaces to fuel creativity, spark innovation, enjoy moments of solitude, conduct a private meeting or brainstorm ideas in small groups, with the effect of boosting productivity and enhancing efficiency."
