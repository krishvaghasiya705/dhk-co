                    "Despite the need to navigate challenges such as international geopolitical crises, the impact of climate change, and regional conflict, East Africa remains the most buoyant region on the continent. This was the key takeaway from the East Africa Property Investment (EAPI) conference, held in Nairobi in early May. The premier property networking event in the region reconnects investors, developers and industry leaders from Africa and globally. The theme this year, Positioning for Opportunity, was apt for the summit which presented a refreshed platform for developers and investors seeking to capitalise on the East African opportunity. It was exciting to learn how East Africa is working hard to be the next main hub and how the banks, investors and developers are supporting that growth.",
                    "A 2024 report by the African Development Bank Group (ADBG) projected East Africa's growth to rise to5.7% in 2025, an increase following a forecast of 5.1% in 2024. In addition to the region’s emergence from the Covid-19 pandemic with a strong economic recovery in 2020, and its rapid economic rebound in 2021 and 2022, the report notes that “East Africa has continued to set a standard for antifragility on the continent…despite a slowdown in 2023, driven primarily by conflict in Sudan.” The report pointed to projections that the region is poised to return in 2024and 2025.",
                    "With these prospects, East Africa remains attractive for investment and development. But the question becomes, how do developers and investors position themselves for the EastAfrican opportunity."

Proven performers such as improving political stability, stabilising interest rates, and development demand in Tanzania and Zanzibar, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia support the impetus. Kenya and surrounding countries, for example, are recording GDP growth projections between 2025 and 2029 which are higher than the continent’s traditional economic powerhouse of South Africa. This reflects higher investor confidence in those countries compared with the SADC region.",
                    "The opportunity for doing business in the region exists, and is growing. The region is seen as part of the African 'circuit' alongside Cape Town's Table Mountain and food culture, the Kenyan Serengeti migrations, the Maasai Mara, Gorillas of Uganda and Rwanda and the beaches of the Seychelles. Tourism, particularly in Kenya, was cited as a growth area. In 2024, Nairobi was awarded Africa's Leading Business Travel Destination at the 2024 World Travel Awards. For designers, this presents an exciting opportunity to explore how hospitality and interior design could, and arguably, should, shape the African tourism industry."

Millennials and Gen Z, are among the influx of people moving back home after spending time abroad, bringing with them are defined sense of luxury, and desires and expectations that differ from what previous generations considered to be luxury. An important shift is the urge to preserve the environment. In this respect, the clear message to designers is the need todesign spaces that are more agile and that respond more to the melting pot of cultures living and working in the same spaces. Design can no longer be considered in isolation.",
                    "This is most seen in the need for inner city regeneration and the provision of accommodation, amenities and services for young professionals and students. This is paired with a need for additional schools and tertiary education centres as well as growth and enhancements in healthcare.",

The technology is here to stay, and we need to find a way of effectively and safely integrating it into our work. Within our own BIM team, our research and development (R&D) team is briefed to test new software and artificial intelligence (AI) technology workflows to improve how BIM is delivered, and how we deliver architectural designs. At the same time, in each scheme, our urban designers, architects and interior designers consider how to promote and facilitate human interactions. While AI could be prompted to design a building, the human nature of how people interact and use the space and surrounds cannot be digitally replicated."

You can’t pretend you don’t use them, because everyone does, and there is so much visual material out there. What always works best is finding an object or some personal aspect relating to your client or the building you are in that has historical value. Exploring the relationship between this object and your client and turning it into something special and unique is precious. I remember finding a Nguni hairpin while working on a project many years ago. We used it to make beautiful sculptural timber screens for a client’s office. That was 15 years ago, and I think she is still there and still enjoys those screens, it’s priceless. It was in the moment and there was a bit of luck.

                    "Currently, this team is involved in the redevelopment of <a href='https://dhk-dev.webflow.io/projects/city-park' target='__blank'>City Park</a>, which occupies an entire city block bounded by Bree, Loop, Longmarket and Church Streets in the most central part of the Cape Town City Bowl. This is an innovative mixed-use development comprising a 127-key hotel, 68 branded apartments, retail space, 1 002 parking bays, 10 500 m² of premium grade offices and a co-working space.",
                    "Throughout her work, Leigh emphasises empowering team members and fostering a collaborative, inclusive environment – something at the heart of dhk’s DNA.",
                    "“You’ve got to give credit where it’s due, push people forward and give them a platform, tools and latitude to perform their role to the fullest. That’s what allows people to step forward and fully occupy their roles. I try to maintain an atmosphere where people can fail and make mistakes, assuring them that it’s okay along the way,” Leigh explains.",
                    "She laughs, adding, “I don’t want it to sound like I’m encouraging a litany of errors, but it’s about creating an inclusive, collaborative environment where people feel empowered to express themselves and experiment. If you don’t create that space, people don’t grow and you don’t innovate. We can talk about striving for excellence, but what drives that is an atmosphere where people are allowed to be themselves, take risks and push boundaries.",
                    "Leigh references Danish physicist Niels Bohr’s famous observation that, “An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.” She believes that’s how true learning happens and that once you’ve experienced those failures and learned from them, you build the confidence to take on new challenges."

She concedes that a different mindset is needed as a leader of a large practice from being a sole proprietor. “When you’re running your own business, you’re the only checkpoint – which has both advantages and disadvantages,” she says.",
                    "She enjoys the strong support at dhk, which she believes also makes it easier to scale through delegation in a way that is very difficult as a sole trader.",
                    "While modernism strikes a chord with Leigh in terms of inspiration, the way she describes her approach to design matches dhk’s holistic, integrated philosophy. The shared focus on putting people at the centre of design made it a perfect match from the start.",
                    "Leigh explains: “I like to be context driven and take all the indicators into account. It’s rather the drivers of the project that determine the type of architecture. So, it’s more of a sensitive and responsive approach to design that I favour. It’s also about practicality.",
                    "“I think you need to come up with the most efficient solution, a solution that’s most responsive to the context, site and climate within which you find it, and you must be sensitive to your client’s needs in terms of budget, time constraints. They’re all outputs governed by unique characteristics of that project. That’s what drives me a lot. It’s less about bold statements and more about sensitivity and responsiveness to the needs of the project which is aligned with the practice’s general ethos.”",
                    "Leigh references <a href='httpshttps://dhk-dev.webflow.io/journal/bringing-an-old-battery-to-life' target='__blank'>Battery Park</a> as one of her favourite dhk projects that encapsulates this ethos.",
                    "She explains: “It’s essentially a parking area with a facing on it, which could have been quite mundane. It’s also a precious heritage resource that we made interventions in. I think the way it was done was handled quite sensitively. I think it’s also very successful in the way it presents itself and in the way it’s been accepted by the community. It’s a much-loved space and it’s well tenanted and used. It’s a project that has a lot more joy and beauty to it. It was handled very well.”"

                    "In April 2024, Leigh’s contributions to architecture earned her recognition on Africans Column’s list of 50 Influential African Women Architects. She was among seven other amazing South African women architects on the list and was lauded for her commitment to inspiring inclusivity and gender equality in architecture, striving to motivate and create space for future female leaders in the industry.",
                    "When asked about her impressions of how the industry has evolved in terms of gender diversity since she started her career and what changes she’d like to see, Leigh believes that the industry is gradually evolving, although it remains a male-dominated field.",
                    "“When I started there was far less gender diversity than there is now. Every year it kind of improves. You could tell with our graduating class. We were completely outnumbered in terms of men versus women and that’s obviously what’s going out into the world, but it’s still very male dominated. I would love to see it changing faster, but you’re redressing a situation that was completely out of balance before and so it takes time,” she says.",
                    "With 22 years in the industry, it’s safe to say that Leigh, who also juggles the roles of daughter, sister, wife and mother to her 15-year-old daughter, knows a thing or two about what it takes to succeed in the industry. She’s open about the demands of the profession, saying that architecture requires dedication and hard work, and the ability to not only look at the world, but to see the world beyond your own and through different eyes.",
                    "She concludes: “You have to be passionate about what you’re doing and fully invested in this career. There’s also a lot of responsibility and risk. In terms of building projects, architects are seen as the lead. We have to lead the design, coordination, packaging, presentation and on-site supervision of projects. It’s an incredibly responsible role and you have to be willing to take on that kind of responsibility. I think if it’s something you’re passionate about, it can be incredibly rewarding.",
                    "“If it’s your passion and you can see that for yourself, then success will come naturally. I also think architectural knowledge is esoteric and difficult to come by. The training at university doesn’t prepare you for real working world. You’ve got to be out there and curious and expose yourself.”"

At times, the project was a rollercoaster, with structural challenges and Covid-19 lockdowns. But it also provided valuable lessons and opportunities for creative solutions such as using fritting on glass to reduce heat and diffuse harsh light, and innovating with Wedi building boards – a product Jankel had never used before.",

In 2015, an urban design framework was developed to reinvigorate the area.",

The award-winning initiative was founded in 1999 through collaboration between companies in the built environment, the Western Cape Department of Education and civil society. It offers students from underprivileged communities in Cape Town and Johannesburg an education development programme from Grade 10 through 12, followed by an internship year and tertiary education support. Once students graduate, they’re guaranteed employment with partner companies.",
                    "Go for Gold assists around 150 high school learners annually through its Education Development Programme. The organisation also places 40 students in internships at partner companies and helps 300 students pursue higher education at various institutions. Additionally, the programme celebrates about 40 technical graduates each year, some of whom serve as mentors to younger Go for Gold students.",
                    "Kaneasha describes her experience of the programme as an enriching one, and she’s already paying it forward. Go for Gold has enabled her to grow both in her personal capacity and as a professional. On 21 June 2024, the 25-year-old was part of a dhk team that attended the annual Go for Gold Career Jamboree held at Cape Town High School. She described the moment as heartwarming, remembering being in the same shoes as the students she met that day. She took time to share with them advice and insights about her career journey.",
                    "Reflecting on her time in the programme, she said: “I know that some people say it’s a waste of time to do an internship before studying, but for me, I felt that if it wasn’t for this experience, I probably wouldn’t have been able to survive during my studies. It’s good to get a glimpse into what exactly you’ll be getting into for the rest of your life. For me, Go for Gold has been invaluable and has moulded me into the person I am.",
                    "“I often remember how shy I was, but through the support and mentorship over the years, I have become much more confident in my abilities and as a person. I’m now in my third year of work at dhk. I feel like there are always people cheering me on, which is an amazing feeling.”",
                    "At the Go for Gold Career Jamboree, Bridget-Ann Mullins, the National Director for Go for Gold, expressed similar sentiments, emphasising the importance of exposing students not only to the variety within the built environment but also to higher education institutions.",
                    "“It’s fundamental that students from disadvantaged communities are allowed the opportunity to explore what the built environment actually means. Although we can tell them about it, being able to see it tangibly, speak to other people, see the models and link to those in the industry just creates an awareness and opens up a pathway for informed decision-making about their futures,” noted Bridget-Ann."

                TopicPara: "The East Africa Property Investment Summit is the premier property networking event in the region. The two-day event reconnects investors, developers and industry leaders from Africa and globally. This year’s event welcomed over 443 attendees from 19 countries, in a dynamic event of open discussion and friendly networking. dhk Partners Peter Fehrsen and Peter Stokes attended the conference this year. In this article, they share their observations about notable discussions that took place, with a focus on mixed-use developments and public-private partnerships.",
                Topiccontent: [
                    "Mixed-use developments and public-private partnerships (PPPs) are familiar terrain in dhk’s projects, and these approaches form a strong backbone of our knowledge and experience. The conference discussions featured these as potential strategies for fostering development in the region.",
                    "Peter Fehrsen reflects on the main thrust of the conversations: “The discussions covered public-private partnerships (PPPs), mixed-use development and adaptive reuse of existing buildings. There was a growing focus on sustainability, particularly in respect of brownfield redevelopment and urban regeneration, especially in post-colonial cities that have degraded over time.” While regeneration can be seen as gentrification – a practice that often draws criticism and highlights concerns that the traditional character of neighbourhoods could be lost in the process, done carefully and inclusively, densification, urban upgrades and mixed-use projects can be useful tools for revitalising cities.",
                    "This is where partnerships come into play, as effective levers for sustainable regeneration. The entire conference was geared towards the East African development opportunity and its growing attractiveness as an investment destination. But, notes Fehrsen, successful ventures will depend on the strength of local partnerships.",
                    "He explains: “One strategy is to leverage existing relationships with local architects and influential or locally connected players active in the region. It’s about collaborating humbly, navigating delicately, finding your niche and contributing without arrogance,” says Fehrsen.",
                    "Peter Stokes agrees, adding, “Don’t underestimate the power and the need to have a local architect and to cultivate those relationships.”",
                    "Cultivating this mindset offers a greater impetus towards achieving development goals.",
                    "Fehrsen continues: “It’s more about improving the urban environment. Achieving alignment with municipalities, local and regional authorities, and tying in with their improved housing policies to finance projects that can accommodate communities in safe environments. So, if you can embark upon some form of public participation or partnership, it could be possible to increase the funds available, spreading the resources between public and private sources. A PPP also enables development of degraded inner-city areas, reinforcing local densification policies and stimulating greater interest in preserving heritage. All those things are becoming important.”",
                    "An example of this approach is dhk’s project to develop a public realm strategy for Bellville, Cape Town, with the Greater Tygerberg Partnership – an entity created as a public-private partnership with the City of Cape Town. The plan prioritises pedestrians, non-motorised transport and public transport, as well as creating positive public spaces for formal and informal traders. This kind of public sector investment is vital as it democratises access to spaces and shows tangible government commitment, thereby driving private sector investment and ultimately leading to regeneration.",
                    "Regarding mixed-use developments, Peter Stokes notes a trend towards incorporating retail components. He notes that mixed-use in denser urban environments is inevitable and is key to creating compact, vibrant and walkable neighbourhoods. He explains: “It is not uncommon to have a diversified urban development, anchored by commercial office, hospitality or residential tenants, to be integrated with appropriate retail space to activate the street. So there’s a kind of formula in which multiple uses or experiences can be brought to bear on how retail works.”",
                    "dhk’s experience in various use types, as well as our urban-centric and placemaking mindset, assists with the integration of uses to create a coherent, secure, legible and economic proposition. This is a tried and tested formula that helps to create the necessary bustle to sustain urban living. Our project at <a href='https://dhk-co.netlify.app/projects/oxford-parks,-rosebank' target='__blank'>Oxford Parks</a> is a notable example of this. Arising from the Dunkeld Design Manual, a masterplan for the area which we developed in 2015, the Oxford Park precinct incorporates commercial buildings and hospitality uses, with retail uses, set in a well-designed walkable, pedestrian-friendly environment that activates the street level and stimulates activity day and night."

The win prompted the decision to open an office in Johannesburg.",

He started to commute to the Johannesburg studio in early 2000, and, after he and management decided that the team needed a Partner in place, he relocated to be there full time in 2013. Martin made the same move in 2020, strategically strengthening the Johannesburg leadership team. “Martin brings a wealth of experience and quickly became an indispensable part of our team. Now, with his promotion to Partner, we have a great platform for strategic growth of the Joburg studio,” says Peter.",

In Cape Town he worked on Battery Park, a 12,000m² urban park situated at the V&A Waterfront, and 32 Napier Street which comprises 19 high-end residential apartments. He was also integrally involved in the development of the Old Cape Quarter in De Waterkant – a neighbourhood which dates back to the 18th century – where dhk’s Cape Town office is situated.",

We learnt an enormous amount and realised that we have the flexibility to expand and contract on different projects. But we believe in building a studio environment, where collaboration and connection enhances the creative process.” The studio now hosts 20+ people.",

In many cases it’s not red tape which causes delays, says Peter, but getting the financial models to work so that projects can get off the ground. The office market remains challenging, and while the residential rental market is strong, sales need to be driven by well-targeted marketing campaigns",

Our staff complement is growing on the back of a good flow of work here in Johannesburg, in Africa, and in the Middle East.

The retention and reuse of existing structures has several benefits, including improving the ecological footprint, and improving proposals by retaining features of the streetscape that the local community have become familiar with.”",

He plays a key leadership role at dhk including strategic business development for the practice, as well as entrenching urban design as a pivotal discipline in dhk. Earlier this year he was invited to present an overview of architectural and property development trends in Cape Town for the property industry seminar series hosted by the University of Cape Town’s Urban Real Estate Research Unit (URERU). In contrast to the statistical approach favoured in many of these seminars, Guy promised to provide a subjective, anecdotal and non-statistical view of the way in which the Cape Town property market was shaping up post-Covid.",
                    "A common thread in Guy’s view is that property development is no longer about simply providing space. Increasingly, it’s about place and placemaking, essentially providing high-quality environments that have a particular identity. It is this distinction that attracts people and drives value."

The resulting mini boom is being driven by, and is in response to, three key social trends. At the same time, six spatial and environmental trends are shaping the form of development emerging in the city."

We’re seeing evidence of this demand from a number of our clients; it’s particular noteworthy that dhk client Balwin Properties, headquartered in Johannesburg and operating across the country, is selling more properties in the Western Cape than in any other region in the country. This trend is not only in Cape Town, it’s manifesting in towns like Stellenbosch and all along the Garden Route too.",
                    "Stellenbosch is experiencing a big surge in demand across a wide range of housing types. Demand in this university town is driven by a combination of the general semigration trend coupled with the mini boom in demand for student accommodation that is happening nationwide. Supply in Stellenbosch is frustrated by a shortage of space and stringent development control, which is driving property value to extraordinary levels in this winelands town.",
                    "Similarly in George, where we are currently busy with the development of an estate for 300 new family homes, the opportunity to live and work (remotely) in this small but thriving town is proving highly attractive to those fed up with the chronic crime and infrastructure issues of Johannesburg, and other major cities elsewhere in the country."

                    "At the same time, the post-Covid workplace has given rise to new attitudes to work, including the ‘great resignation’ and ‘quiet quitting’. In an attempt to persuade employees to re-engage and return to the office, corporate employers are aiming to make work ‘meaningful’, or at least to make the workplace more fun. In response, our interior design business – dhki – has developed an approach to the workplace that mirrors the spaces of a village, aiming to bring the spaces of home to the place of work.",

This project extends our work for the Capitec Bank headquarters building in Stellenbosch completed in 2020. By optimising internal flow, the design fosters a company culture of creativity, innovation, collaboration and departmental interaction.

                    "Cities were largely mixed-use until around 70 years ago when we started separating the different components of cities – industry, office, residential, etc. – through land use zoning. In South Africa, this also became a mechanism to institutionalise the separation of people based on skin colour, giving rise to apartheid spatial planning. In the last 20 years, there has been a major pushback globally against land use zoning and the separation of uses. This is equally applicable in SA, although despite best intentions, we have been much less successful at reversing apartheid spatial planning (I pick this theme up again under trend 6 below).",
                    "An example of the return of mixed use is Rosebank in Johannesburg. The newly emerging mixed-use node of Rosebank takes its cue from Melrose Arch, a stone’s throw away down Corlett Drive. dhk designed Melrose Arch phase 2, which wraps a hotel, apartments, offices and retail in a series of perimeter blocks, pedestrian streets and an arcade around a new public space/piazza.",
                    "Rosebank seems to be one area that is holding its own in a city in decline and is fast becoming one of the most desirable destinations in the city, incorporating a mix of uses and activities and pedestrian-friendly public spaces – upstaging car-dominated Sandton, just down the road. This is part of the reason we’ve just moved our Johannesburg office to Rosebank. We’ve also recently completed phase one of Oxford Parks for Intaprop – bringing together a hotel, offices and retail uses in an extension of the Rosebank mixed-use node. Residential apartments are included in future phases of Oxford Parks, as well as in adjacent developments such as One Rosebank, which we’re currently taking through construction for residential developer Tricolt – combining to create an integrated mixed-use, pedestrian friendly environment.",

The Rubik is another mixed-use building we’ve recently completed in the Cape Town CBD. This blends retail, residential and commercial uses in an elegant tower on a tight urban site.",

It’s vital for the future of this country that this experiment works and works well enough that it becomes the norm rather than a talking point.",

It’s another not-so-new trend, but one that is increasing in priority and rapidly evolving. In 2015, dhk’s Portside was delivered as one of Africa’s most sustainable buildings, achieving a 5-Star Green Star rating from the Green Building Council of South Africa (GBCSA), and earning the mantle ‘tallest green star rated building in Africa’. While this was significant at the time, the emphasis is now on a 6-Star Green Star rating as standard, and increasingly a focus on buildings with net zero carbon emissions.",

While they are not (yet) looking for green star ratings for the estates as a whole, they’re including solar PV panels, black water treatment plants, tree planting, and pocket parks, among other measures. This isn’t just environmentally conscious – it also makes business sense: their business leaders sit on the GBCSA board. Their approach allows them to secure green bonds for clients at 1% below the prime rate and is a big part of what’s making their estates in the Western Cape successful. It’s a differentiator for Balwin.",

This way, solutions that are data-driven and rooted in the realities of those most affected by urban challenges can be co-created.",

By creating a platform for the voices of unrepresented areas to be heard, the project acknowledges the importance of community input in shaping the future of the city. The approach is being developed as an antithesis of master planning as we look to create a platform where city building becomes an activity of the collective. I believe that the lived experience of these groups of people offer powerful insight into the needs of the neighbourhoods.”",

This includes Tim Stonor, an architect and urban planner, who suggests there are aspects of cities, the finer grain, that cannot be seen through quantitative data. He has also been inspired by the work of city regeneration expert Maria Vassilakou who was the first green vice mayor of Vienna and city councillor for urban development, traffic, climate protection, energy planning and citizen participation. Her view is that if you want to build an inclusive city, there must be a high level of diversity. His other source of inspiration is Alfredo Brillembourg, the co-founding partner of Urban-Think Tank, who believes that the aesthetic of the city should reflect the condition of its people, since people are the true clients for architects.",

                Topiccontent: [
                    "We created this role to take advantage of Wardah’s deep interest in professional development and her equally deep expertise in technical implementation. The appointment reflects our commitment to building and nurturing the next generation of architects – a responsibility we take seriously, as leaders in our field. We’re also focused on boosting our team’s capability not only as skilled designers but also experts in design implementation, and this appointment enables us to do just that.",
                    "Wardah joined dhk as an Architectural Technologist in 2006. With so much time under her belt, she’s one of very few people who have the depth of institutional knowledge to equip her for the training component of her new role. She’s familiar with most of our projects, giving her a broad and deep understanding how we do things in the practice.",
                    "While we’re fully committed to finding new ways of doing things – innovating in our projects and systems – we also know how important it is to entrench the best of our working practices into the hearts and minds of everyone involved in design and implementation.",
                    "“We’re doing the work to make our designs work,” says Wardah, “but we don’t need to reinvent the wheel each time.” In this, she refers to the focus on refining details in a way that makes our designs more robust, while sharing technical expertise to support progress on our projects and relationships between our clients. She consults with project teams, with a focus on building efficiency and transferring skills. “It means we can deliver a better product for our clients — better buildings developed with better systems,” she says.",
                    "Wardah’s other superpower is inspiring and mentoring aspiring and new architects. She shepherds the interns and <a href='https://dhk-co.netlify.app/journal/meet%20kaneasha%20hanning%2C%20go-for-gold%20alumni' target='__blank'>Go-for-Gold students</a>, creating opportunities for them to learn about the craft of architecture from within the practice and through exposure to others outside of our doors. She does this by collaborating with other internal and external teams to create engaging programmes of learning that cover topics like model-making, graphic design and sketching, construction technology, and the history and appreciation of architecture. Crucially, Wardah also mentors the students, guiding them through their academic year and providing a support system in and out of the classroom, with empathy and love. “Everything is important,” she says, “I take it very personally, and am genuinely excited about their growth and progress within the business.”",
                    "Wardah has been in that position herself, seeking guidance and exploration from the earliest days of her career. When she was looking for a study path, her first preference was for journalism, but when the course was full, she opted to do a foundation course that included multiple areas of design – graphic, industrial, interior, among others. She fell in love with each discipline, but it was the architectural discipline that hooked and fascinated her most.",
                    "Wardah started her career doing a short stint as an intern at a smaller practice, but dhk is effectively her first “real” job. She attributes her success in the organisation to having good mentors who had the patience, and who gave her the space, to develop. As she says, “they encouraged and inspired me to think critically, develop my opinions and push stereotypical boundaries; to ‘sit on the fence’ and aspire to be an all-rounder.” As a result, Wardah has a broad focus on design resolution and refinement, with a corresponding ability to develop technical solutions and documentation packages.",
                    "She has completed postgraduate courses in Construction Management and Human Resources. With a natural curiosity and a love for learning new things, Wardah also immerses herself in online short courses that very often have nothing to do with architecture."

                    "Her first introduction to architecture was, in her words, not what she expected: “I was more idealistic, not expecting how much waterproofing detailing was needed,” she says, with a wry smile. At the time, she was undertaking her practical year while pursuing her Bachelor of Architecture Studies (BAS). Faced with the underwhelming reality, she turned her attention to the discipline of interior design, starting out with a small studio that specialised in designing interiors for high-end residential clients.",
                    "The experience there sparked a love for designing interiors to, as Lisa says: “see the results of our labour emerging more quickly. The product comes to life and can have a direct influence on how the users experience their environments.” Lisa also appreciates the opportunity to connect directly with the end users, understanding who they are and making decisions based on deeper insights that can shape their daily experience.",
                    "However, delving deeply into the minutiae of designing interiors for individual residences can have its drawbacks, as Lisa describes. “I found myself having arguments about the soap dishes in the guest loo. It was another revelation that made me rethink my path. I thought ‘this cannot be the reason why I wake up every morning.’”",
                    "She needed to recalibrate her journey once again, and jumped at an invitation to work with a team who were starting a furniture retail venture that incorporated an interior design service. The progression from luxury residential into hospitality and hotels opened another world for Lisa. She found her niche there, and over the next few years delivered interiors for nearly 30 hotels across Africa.",
                    "The experience gave Lisa a chance to get her hands dirty, understanding the technical form and function of furniture, fixtures and equipment (FF&E). “There is a level of detail that I really appreciate,” she says. “You need to understand not only the aesthetics, but how products are made, to ensure you’re specifying what the clients need for their unique locations.” This detailing gave Lisa an intimate knowledge that has supported her throughout her career to date, whether designing fabrics, rugs or specifying fixtures and fittings. “Knowing the difference between a turned brass or a cast brass tap in a tropical climate could be the difference between those taps lasting for years, or the client having to replace them within a short space of time. That knowledge is crucial to designs that are durable and sustainable.”",
                    "She moved to Cape Town and joined dhk Thinkspace in 2007, continuing to service clients in the hospitality sector, before stepping out into Peg Designs, her own venture, which soon grew into a team of 12. dhk engaged Peg as a consultant on interior design projects for their clients and in October 2022, as Lisa says, “we decided to put a ring on it,” and dhk and Peg merged to form dhk Interior Design.",
                    "“I saw, and still see, immense potential for growth,” says Lisa, on her decision to join forces with the practice. Since launching, dhki has completed projects for the Myspace student accommodation at Stellenbosch University, and for the newly refurbished Grand Hotel at Grandwest in Cape Town, as well as an office suite for the Cape Grace hotel management. Other projects currently underway include the new Learning Centre at Bishops School, the interiors of the Cape Grace refurbishment, and other projects for retail, corporate, multi-residential and call centre clients.",
                    "Having such a diverse portfolio is a deliberate choice, says Lisa: “The sectors balance each other, and the diversity means we can build a versatile team who are specialists in each area, without relying on a pipeline from one source only.” The knowledge gained within each sector is implemented in others, augmenting the team’s knowledge and supporting their offering across the board.",
                    "Lisa and her team of eight are driven not by a single signature, but by the need to translate client needs into great designs, challenging the designers to exceed expectations and to stand proudly by the designs they create.",
                    "When asked what her superpower is, Lisa answers quickly and unequivocally: “My leadership style is to recognise that my team members are all human, I try to give them the tools to help them give their best. But I can only do that when they are seen and heard.”",

Located at a key entranceway into Century City and serving as the front face of both Bridgeways Precinct and the future Ratanga Precinct, the challenge was not only to design a landmark building and to take advantage of the desirable corner views but to maximize the potential rentable area of the island site’s unique shape. Functionally, the building needed to allow for flexible subdivisions for numerous potential tenants both within the building, as well as on the same floor.",
                    "Derick Henstra, dhk executive chairman, says: “Responding to the opportunities and restraints of the site, the design required strong roadside frontage to the southwest and a more functional and accessible podium back edge to the northeast. As a result, our team conceived a dual-facing building with two merged forms – a striking front-facing curvilinear glazed element contrasted with a formal punctured box structure. The shape of the building was not only intentionally designed to highlight the site’s unique shape but to maximize the floorplates and potential rentable area”.",
                    "Facing Sable Road, the building’s distinctive curved glazed facade wraps around its corner location into Bridgeways Precinct and the future Ratanga Precinct. Not only does the curvilinear curtain wall serve as the central design feature of the building but it provides transparency, allowing for outward views across the city and overlooking the mountains. Complementing and drawing parallels with its neighbour, Sable Park, the glazed facade is articulated with robust vertical aluminium fins which extend past the roofline. Adjacent to this, a more functional, textured and punctured face brick box structure delineates the remainder of the Sable Road edge, designed to enable the curvilinear element to stand out. Below, the entire ground floor along Sable Road and atop the podium has been fitted out with glazed frontage and has the potential to serve as future retail space.",

Here, the entrance lobby opens up to the visitor’s parking and pedestrian walkways to the wider Bridgeways Precinct. The solid boxed form is highlighted with grey painted face brick panels contrasted with solid white Marmoran-finished brickwork elements. An architectural glazed circulation staircase and lift lobby links the convex-shaped section of the building to a rectangular appendix, allowing for economical floorplate usage while contributing to the overall design quality of the building.",
                    "Internally, the finishes are primarily reliant on future tenants and the common areas, such as the bathrooms and lobbies, are finished in Cape slate tiles and highlighted with timber-clad feature walls which bring a definitive sense of warmth to the spaces. In the near future, views towards the northeast will include the redeveloped Ratanga Junction and will retain a strong focus on water and soft landscaping.",

Fuel efficient parking bays have been provided should tenants decide to incorporate their own green transport strategies which are further enhanced by access to public transport and easily accessible local amenities. LED lighting has been installed throughout, saving energy and maintenance costs while external lighting has been designed to avoid light pollution.

The building, developed by Abland Property Developers and designed by dhk Architects, is characterised by a singular sculpted massing which is transformed via dynamic glazed planes that extend seamlessly over the office and parking levels. The two main corners of the building are chamfered towards the roofline and soar upwards, forming a striking wing-like effect – resulting in a distinctive, non-orthogonal addition to Cape Town’s skyline.",
                Topiccontent: [
                    "The site is located in Roggebaai (Cape Town’s growing financial and hospitality precinct) and was previously occupied by an eight-storey 1980s office building which prior to that was part of the now-demolished Long Street Power Station site. While the peninsula site has three street frontages and the public domain experiences high levels of pedestrian traffic, it previously suffered from extremely limited street activation. This was compounded by the last remaining portion of the demolished power station (Site B), hostile frontages of both the 80-metre office building to the south and dilapidated office building to the east. A fundamental component of the design concept involved maximising the activation of the street edge with retail to improve the quality and safety of the public realm, as well as to take advantage of the high levels of pedestrian traffic passing the building.",
                    "The initial brief to remodel and extend the existing 1980s building were discarded due to impractical core design, the limitations of adding floors, the need to replace an outdated façade and challenges with long-term viability. The revised brief, by the co-owners Ellerine Bros and Abland, was to offer a more positive medium- to long-term viability, as well as to enhance Cape Town’s skyline with a decidedly taller, inspirational tower building. However, the challenge was to maximise the quality multi-tenant commercial space while accommodating core components such as lifts and stairs along with structured basement parking – all within a relatively small floor plate.",
                    "To maximise the floor plates, dhk proposed a simple singular orthogonal massing bar the articulation of the southeastern and southwestern corners. While fundamentally a solid building mass, the appearance of a dynamic, non-orthogonal sculpted mass was created via tapering or cranked façade planes which extend seamlessly over the office and parking levels. This was achieved by chamfering both the southeast and southwest corners of the building at the top of the orthogonal parking base and widening them towards the roof. The technique articulates the façade and defragments the solidity of the corners of the building as the wings shape the elevations and extend past the top office floor. By extending the wing-shaped façade screens beyond the roof level with parapet sloping, the appearance of soaring shards is created opposed to an abrupt utilitarian termination.",
                    "In terms of materiality, a glazed façade was selected due to its flush and sculpted reflective form which is able to conceal both the parking levels and solid spandrels. Not only does glass facilitate an exciting play of light but it allows for an expressive articulation of the building mass in the screen and shard-like elements.The introduction of pixilation on the portions fronting the parking levels, ceiling voids, structure and internal desk height upstands allows the building to conceal both the parking levels and avoid overbearing horizontal bands.",
                    "The entire length of the street frontage along Lower Long Street and Jetty Street is enlivened with new ground-floor retail and multiple entry points into the office building. At street level, a double-volume entrance connects to shuttle lifts connecting all parking levels and the ground floor to a spectacular arrival experience within the 10th-floor sky lobby. Thereafter, individuals are transported via a double-volume area and terrace to the office lifts which connects to all the floors above. This ensures mid-building activation and an experience for all users to enjoy as part of the arrival journey into the workspaces – encouraging interaction between different tenants.",
                    "Internally, the building offers expansive 360-degree views over the city, ocean and mountains. The glazed façade allows for floor-to-ceiling unencumbered vistas enhanced by glazing with mullions at 2.4-metre-wide centres. The chamfered corners also offer oblique views which facilitate the appreciation of the architectural form both externally and internally – a desirable design aspect often not apparent in tall buildings. Furthermore, the multi-purpose roof area with terraces above both chamfered corners offers a spectacular city entertainment space and signifies high-level activation. From an external viewpoint, the perimeter desk height upstands provide ease of furnishing right against the perimeter with fire separation between the floors, therefore, the office furniture is concealed when viewed externally.",
                    "The immediate neighbour to the north and sharing a common boundary is a nine-storey 1980s building which has the potential to be redeveloped in the future. Rather than merely providing an unsightly blank common boundary façade, dhk articulated both northern corners by returning the glazing around onto the common boundary. This is sacrificial in the sense that the neighbour could in future build higher against the common boundary. It also offers spectacular corner northern views towards Cape Town’s harbour. The solid wall concealing the stair core is pixelated with coloured plastered panels, echoing the glazed façade’s articulation.",
                    "Fortunately, the client championed environmental sustainability. To achieve a 4-Star GBCSA Design rating, a detailed environmental performance modelling study was undertaken. This required a high-performance double-glazed specification with increased internal cill height raised to desk height – to reduce both solar gain and radiant heat which significantly lowered HVAC requirements. Other environmental considerations included building efficiency, choice of materials, energy-efficient lighting and services, lower parking ratio encouraging the use of public transport, as well as showers and bicycle parking facilities.",

Pierre Swanepoel, dhk partner and lead architect on the project, says “With its sleek, sculpted form and soaring-shaped facade, 35 Lower Long is an exemplar of how client requirements can be met without comprising on design standards. dhk is extremely proud of this building and views it as a catalyst for future developments to come in Cape Town’s CBD”."

Originally constructed in 1922 by prominent architecture firm Parker & Forsyth for the United Tobacco Companies Limited (UTC), the building once housed the company’s administration department. Transformed by multidisciplinary design studio, dhk Architects, 32 on Kloof’s rich history has been respected via a contemporary aesthetic that references, rather than replicates, its existing heritage.",

                    "UTC, a South African subsidiary of the United Kingdom’s Imperial Tobacco Company and the United States’ American Tobacco Company, was founded in 1904. Shortly thereafter, the company began to acquire portions of what had been the Nooitgedacht farm on the doorstep of the historic Company’s Gardens to establish premises for manufacturing cigarettes and tobacco products. Several buildings were erected in phases between 1900 and 1922, forming the UTC campus which comprised a warehouse, factory and staff facilities.",
                    "The collection of historic red and white masonry buildings still occupy the 112-year-old precinct and have since been recognized by the Western Cape as heritage buildings to be protected and preserved. Developed by Growthpoint Properties and designed by dhk, the primarily landlocked site flanked by Kloof Street is undergoing development and represents a R550 million investment in the city. Once complete the revitalized precinct, now named ‘Longkloof’, will invigorate the area – providing new commercial and retail spaces, a 150-key Canopy by Hilton hotel, and secure pedestrian routes linking Kloof Street to Cape Town’s CBD.",
                    "The client brief for Longkloof’s catalyst project, 32 on Kloof, was to establish additional premium rentable space by adding two floors to the existing building, maximising the floorplates and reinventing the windowless basement. Ultimately, the client’s vision was for 32 on Kloof to serve as the attractive ‘front face’ of the Longkloof precinct concealed from Kloof Street. dhk’s response was to respect the buildings’ heritage and intentionally contrast its existing order and rhythm with a new contemporary addition. This concept allows for an honest dialogue between heritage and contemporary elements, forming a hybrid of architecture that politely enhances the building’s street presence."

Not only does the glazed façade showcase the property’s enviable Table Mountain and City Bowl views, but the two distinct levels provide a clear distinction between old and new – referencing, not replicating, the building’s heritage. Deep expressed aluminium-clad fins articulate the façade, contrasting the historic building’s order and rhythm while acting as a ‘stitching device’ integrating the heritage detail with the contemporary portion. To ensure a single articulated composition of contrast, building setbacks permitted by Heritage Western Cape were contested. Overall, the minimalist design refrains from competing with nor detracting from the building’s heritage, ensuring that the total building mass and scale are sympathetic to its surroundings. Occupied by Workshop17, a provider of co-working spaces, the building offers 30 private offices, nine meeting rooms, three boardrooms, a seminar room, event space and bar, six lounges and libraries, and a courtyard and café.

Striking and otherworldly, dhk’s holistic architectural approach considers both the exterior and interior to optimise corporate expenditure, internal flow and sustainability – demonstrating that commercial offices can be innovative and cost-effective while driving operational efficiencies.",

                    "Capitec’s success and growth over time meant that the company came to occupy numerous offices. These offices were geographically dispersed, resulting in departments becoming increasingly isolated from one another with the need to move between buildings to meet face-to-face. Consequently, Capitec opted to consolidate its staff and facilities into one operationally efficient headquarters. Located in the scenic Cape Winelands in South Africa, a key driver of the design concept involved capturing panoramic vistas and drawing the landscape within.",
                    "The building form optimises the shape and size of the site while referencing the brand’s distinctive curved logo. The three-storey superstructure wraps around itself, which creates a unique ‘doughnut’ shape and forms a central triple-volume atrium – an internal ‘social spine’ at the heart of the building. Contributing to the contemporary appearance, white aluminium panels clad the building’s sinuous form which is further accentuated with continuous ribbons of fenestration.",
                    "Internally, the design resonates with the company’s progressive outlook – ensuring guests and staff unequivocally feel the spirit of the brand throughout the building. Once at reception, visitors are greeted by a generous triple-volume space that immediately showcases the sophistication and simplicity of the interior architecture. Wide open-plan floorplates loop around the periphery of the atrium which are connected by a series of dramatic bridges and staircases. This was an intentional design element which inter-connects the various departments, creating opportunities for chance collaborative encounters and personal interactions.",
                    "Reinforcing Capitec’s brand identity, the company logo is embossed into the ceiling above reception. Overhead, clerestory windows and large roof lights ensure plentiful natural light and further facilitate the connection to the outside world. Meanwhile, touches of timber have been added throughout the office to introduce a feeling of warmth.",
                    "The new headquarters by dhk fosters a company culture of creativity, innovation and collaboration with a large emphasis placed on optimising internal flow and departmental interaction. The first and second floors, containing the office’s open-plan work areas, are largely void of hierarchal structure and closed-off cubicles. Embracing the concept of agile working, a raised access floor throughout the building facilitates maintenance and future upgrades to services. On each level, a total of four ‘cores’, containing centralized amenities such as kitchenettes, meeting rooms, breakout areas, lockers, bathrooms and fire escapes, serve to augment the floorplates into departmental zones.",
                    "Throughout the building’s ‘social spine’ there are a variety of breakaway areas; from a large ground-floor lounge at reception for guests to await meetings and co-workers to engage, to pause areas on bridges, and an internal landscaped courtyard for staff to rest. These spaces fuel creativity and innovation by allowing employees to slip away from their resident desks to enjoy a moment of solitude, conduct a private meeting or brainstorm ideas in small groups. Not only do these breakout areas increase job satisfaction, but they boost staff productivity and efficiency. Furthermore, there is a full-service kitchen and canteen area with ample seating, a small satellite café, and a grand multifunctional stadium staircase/seating area for company presentations and talks. Other useful facilities include a recording studio, Capitec Bank branch and an ATM lab facility."

Natural light is optimised via clerestory glazing, roof lights and internal courtyard windows, while artificial lighting is zoned and activated by sensors. Environmental performance modelling directly influenced the articulation of the façade. The process informed areas of fenestration, glazing specification, glare control measures and solar shading. Performance modelling also informed the primary ordering of the internal layouts. For example, a circulation zone was provided along the external perimeter of the building to distance resident desks from sources of radiant heat.",

Other sustainability measures include ice storage to offset peak electrical demands, a greywater system, water-saving fittings, building management system for extensive metering and monitoring, double glazing throughout, use of good quality and low maintenance materials, locally sourced materials, water-efficient heat rejection, zero ODP (Ozone Depletion Potential) refrigerants, use of low VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) finishes, borehole and rainwater harvesting for irrigation, water-wise planting and refuse management to encourage separation of waste and recyclables.",
                    "To promote employee well-being, the building is purposefully limited to only two passenger lifts for its workforce of approximately 2,000. This is supplemented by a variety of generous feature stairs to encourage walking and limit the use of confined lift spaces. As such, the fire escape stairs were designed for dual functionality; where the quality of finishes were upgraded, they serve as ‘communication’ stairs. Further promoting employee well-being and to ensure that the needs of universal access were met, Capitec engaged with a disability consultant and an acoustic specialist early on in the design process. The recommendations of both specialists were incorporated into the building. For example, sound-absorbing materials and acoustic separation between meeting rooms were included throughout the building to achieve a specified performance in terms of decibel reduction. Additionally, and beyond the requirements of the regulations, consideration of car parking locations, emergency evacuation, ablutions and vertical circulation, are all examples of how the spirit of universal and inclusive access have been addressed.",

With each project comes a myriad of factors to consider. I find my job is constantly about the challenge of balancing conceptual narratives with hard realities,’ she shares.",

                    "Sarah graduated at both undergraduate and post graduate level from the University of Cape Town. She spent her first five working years at Vivid Architects, learning the rigours of commercial practice and gaining a solid foundation as an architect. Thereafter, her career took off. Sarah explains: ‘in 2011, I got an opportunity to practice urban design at Jakupa Architects and Urban Designers with a focus on public sector projects and participated in several conferences and workshops. From there I moved to dhk where I segued back into architecture. My career at dhk has also seen me rise in the leadership and assist with business development at the company.’ She confesses to be an active person who enjoys hiking, running, swimming and travel. ‘I paint, draw, and watch films in my spare time. I also love a lively evening of debate with friends and good music",
                    "Education projects More recently, Sarah has been developing a focus on education projects. She tells To Build: ‘My current focus lies in the education sector; with both new builds and adaptive reuse of existing structures. ‘With the advent of technology in teaching aids as well as changing pedagogical approaches, we are seeing significant shifts in the various education models on offer in South Africa and abroad.  I think it’s imperative that architects investigate how learning environments might be adapted to accommodate these shifts whilst maintaining sound design principles. the challenge of the disparity of wealth and quality of teaching at our schools makes the challenge in South Africa especially great,’ she adds.",
                    "On being female in a tough professional world ‘I think it’s unfortunate that we women seem to need to perform twice as hard as our male counterparts to gain an equal level of recognition.’ Women architects are sometimes overlooked on their technical knowledge and understanding of construction issues. It kind of feeds into “the fragility myth” that women aren’t cut out for construction site environments. I have found that all you need in order to be competent on site is exposure to the practicalities, common sense, and problem-solving abilities.",
                    "‘Mentorship is also a big issue – so many young women in the industry are citing a lack of guidance and support,’ she says. Young women architects often lack role models. ‘I am interested in finding ways to daylight and normalise accomplished female architects doing extraordinary work so that it becomes just as commonplace to equate brilliance in our field with women as it is with men’, Sarah says",
                    "Current career interests and projects? Sarah is currently involved with an initiative called the Ignite Collective which, together with the Cape Institute for Architecture, the initiative aims to launch a platform which seeks to mobilise the ideas and voices of various disparate projects in addressing transformation in the built environment disciplines, particularly when it comes to the position of marginalised women in the industry.",

                TopicPara: "Leading South African architecture and urban design studio, dhk, has completed Sable Park in Century City in Cape Town. The commercial development comprises two buildings – one of 8 000m² and another of 8 300m² – and sits at a prominent entry point into Century City forming an iconic front face for the suburb. Situated at the southern edge of the blossoming Bridgeways Precinct, it boasts unobstructed panoramic views of Table Mountain.",
                Topiccontent: [
                    "Originally dubbed the ‘macro-chip shuffle’, the buildings’ composition was inspired by shuffling forms that operate independently and adapt to their immediate surroundings. The development was intentionally designed to appear as a single large complex and simultaneously as four small independent volumes depending on where it is viewed from. The four volumes are further broken down into thirds – a double height layered mass and a single height crystalline cube. Each of these thirds shift and jump on the horizontal and vertical plain to achieve maximum views and optimal orientation. A large part of the buildings’ concept was manifested in its structure – creating distinct floating boxes that veer off and cantilever beyond one another.",
                    "Both buildings have four-storeys with two levels of underground parking. The buildings comprise a concrete backbone and glass and aluminium façade cladding with a massive offset concrete cube that is both functional and attractive. dhk associate director and lead architect on the project Henry Abosi says, “On an abstract level, the spaces are duplicated, and the volumes are inverted. This simple application was the singular method to the complexity of the resultant macro-articulation which forms a setting for a series of tableaux with an iconic mountain backdrop. In effect, this complex was set out in scenes that take inspiration from aspects of cinematography and film”.",
                    "In accordance with the shifting floor plates, two systems of glazed façade have been installed over the three levels of office. A deliberate, yet playful interchange of these systems contribute to the aesthetic complexity of the building.",
                    "Internally, the buildings have two wings with a central core and full height atrium bringing light into the centre of the expansive floor plates. The wings are connected by a series of bridges spanning across the atrium at the edge of the main core. The core is a stand-alone element which is exposed on both sides of the building. From the rear, this concrete cube protrudes and is visible from over a kilometre away. It forms the proverbial ‘heart’ of the building, circulating people left to right, up and down and into different chambers in the building.",
                    "Each building encloses a landscaped courtyard, bringing nature into the very fabric of the buildings and provides outdoor breakaway places for staff. On the upper levels, a wrap-around terrace takes advantage of the buildings’ prime position – providing additional outdoor spaces for the offices located on this level.",
                    "Sable Park is the newest addition to Bridgeways Precinct, which is a new neighbourhood that merges lifestyle and commercial functions. Also located in the precinct is Bridge Park, a twin development with over 18 000 sqm of premium grade office space, and Axis, a mixed-use development which is nearing completion – both of which were also designed by dhk."

The linear circulation spine is positioned along this edge, with the galleries and public spaces facing the natural landscape, capturing framed views of the wetland, vineyards and mountains beyond.",

A triple-volume atrium establishes a deliberate visual connection between these zones; one urban, the other natural, and provides a physical transition between these contrasting environments.",

A curved wall that extends into the entrance court, draws visitors past the double-volume restaurant, gallery shop and into the generous reception which calmly directs guests to the central atrium that introduces the main galleries. A terrace along the length of the building incorporates a timber deck serving the restaurant and connects to walkways on either side that lead to the sculpture garden. The grounds also include an amphitheatre, children’s playground, and picnic area.",
                    "The galleries comprise a large environmentally-controlled special exhibitions space, and a series of eight gallery spaces, culminating in a dramatic triple-volume sculpture gallery, a dramatic setting for large-scale pieces with Table Mountain as a backdrop. All the galleries are column free, allowing maximum flexibility for display of all forms of art and they can be treated as separate experiences or a sequential journey as required.",
                    "The very specific technical requirements for the gallery spaces in terms of environment control take into account careful control of light, temperature and humidity, acoustics, and fire prevention. To create the minimal spaces required for the display of art, all services are concealed in the wall and ceiling cavities to create a seamless appearance.",
                    "The programme further dictates the building form, which is split vertically between the ground floor galleries and public spaces, and the first floor where the more private spaces are found; offices, library, bar, a further gallery space and artist’s residence. Art storage vaults are positioned below ground level, with the highest level of security as well as state of the art temperature and humidity control.",
                    "The selected materials palette is raw and honest, comprising primarily precast concrete, natural timber, granite and glass, contrasting the natural landscape. Clerestory windows allow the roof to float above the heavy walls, like the lid of a box concealing treasures within and allowing soft indirect natural light to penetrate the interior spaces.",
                    "The primary internal and external finish is a combination of polished concrete, smooth class one precast concrete panels and textured precast concrete panels. The precast panels went through a rigorous design process of testing and sampling to achieve the desired finish. A Teflon mould was developed to create a horizontal textured pattern on the precast panels, and should the panels become damaged, the mould can be used as a repair tool for any future maintenance. Externally, the precast concrete is finished with a chamfered tartan grid, which draws the eye upwards and lengthways, emphasising the scale of the building. Internally, timber panelling brings warmth to the spaces.",
                    "The site incorporates an incredibly sensitive existing wetland ecosystem that had been historically neglected. The wetland was completely rehabilitated, with alien species removed and its surrounding buffer zones revived and replanted with locally indigenous fynbos, enhanced by other indigenous plants and naturalised species – attracting a multitude of insects and birds onto the site. The wetland is also one of the last known breeding sites of the Western Leopard Toad, an endangered species. In order to allow the toads’ safe passage, concrete culverts were constructed underneath the road, and the embankments and earth ramps were carefully designed to allow the toads to move easily across the site."

                    "In response to the brief, dhk moved away from the traditional rectangular apartment block design and decided to take on a more unconventional form. To make best use of the property’s unobstructed views, dhk proposed four separate elliptical towers. The buildings’ shape takes inspiration from an ellipse (a mathematical term for a curved plane surrounding two focal points) which is highly efficient in terms of ratio of surface area to internal volume. The lack of corners reduces the visual profile of the buildings and was identified as the most suitable form when considering multiple towers in proximity to one another. Inspired by their mathematical origins, each tower is named after some of the world’s most celebrated scientists, namely, ‘Newton’, ‘Kepler’, ‘Cassini’ and ‘Galileo’. Each tower has an identical footprint; however, the height of each differs. ‘Newton’ has 10 storeys, ‘Kepler’ has 11 storeys, ‘Cassini’ has 13 storeys and ‘Galileo’ has 15 storeys.",
                    "The curvilinear façade of the towers is complemented by a mix of moveable and fixed screens which serve to animate the elevations. This produces an ever-changing collage resulting from the movement of the sun and the moods of its occupants.",
                    "The towers sit on a raised podium, creating an elevated ground floor with a parking garage and services infrastructure underneath. Extensively landscaped, the podium level includes a central piazza, running track, active and passive parks, lap and leisure pools, verdant gardens and ’The Luna Club’ to engage residents and encourage community activity. At street level, an elevated forecourt addresses the most prominent corner where retail spaces spill out onto the activated street edges to embrace other users from the broader Waterfall City community.",
                    "The interiors of the buildings have a clean and contemporary aesthetic, complete with ultra-modern finishes, high ceilings and large windows that provide panoramic views of the Gauteng skyline. Designed with user experience in mind, everything has been considered to optimise internal functionality and flow. The interior design was completed by dhk’s sister company, dhk thinkspace.",
                    "Aram Lello, senior associate at dhk and lead architect on the project says, “Our intention was to create spaces for dialogue and community involvement. We critically analysed the requirements of residents to design spaces responding to their needs – we wanted to create homes and a rich sense of community. The buildings embrace diversity through their unique design and the provision of great amenities”.",

Developed as the nucleus of a larger urban vision for the district, the site includes a park and piazza that effectively conceal a 1 206-bay parking facility as well as new pedestrian routes to invigorate the precinct with activity.",
                Topiccontent: [
                    "The site is of archaeological importance as it contains the remnants of one of the city’s oldest structures, coastal fortification the Amsterdam Battery. This provided a unique opportunity for architecture and urban design firm dhk – to pay homage to the historic landmark whilst incorporating a parking facility and providing spaces for leisure and recreational activities.",
                    "The project forms part of an urban design framework created by dhk for the V&A’s previously underutilised Canal District that facilitates the reconnection of the historical city centre and De Waterkant to the V&A. The aim was to create a publicly accessible park which lies at the nexus of a multitude of new pedestrian routes stitching the new district into the surrounding urban fabric and thereby helping to invigorate the area.",
                    "The Amsterdam Battery was erected by the Dutch along Cape Town’s coastline in 1784 to defend the city from seaborne and land attacks. In the 1800s the building was used to house prisoners; and was later remodelled and strengthened by the British but eventually abandoned. In 1905 the battery was largely demolished to make way for railway connections to the port, leaving behind only a small portion of its rear curved walls. The historical remnants are now perched eight metres above the new canal running through the site at a lower level.",
                    "During construction of Battery Park archaeological excavations revealed former datums which were used to inform the design. The raised park has been kept at the battery’s original inner courtyard level whilst planted edges above retail units on the piazza represent the estimated natural ground level that fronted the battery. Various architectural and landscaped elements reflect the structure’s original footprint, such as semi-circular curved pathways, concrete additions to the rear ramparts, splayed canal-facing walls and concrete-clad structures – giving visitors an authentic sense of the battery’s former size. An axial visual connection to Cape Town’s Noon Gun on Signal Hill has also been retained, thus preserving the site’s historic sightline.",
                    "The requirement to respect the original inner courtyard datum and create a lower-level piazza resulted in an elevated park with views across the V&A and CBD but with the challenge of managing the transition between the two levels. Therefore, a large part of Battery Park’s design concept was manifested in breaking the barrier between the park and piazza and bringing them closer to one another. As a result, the park level has been designed to gradually lower towards the canal edge providing a closer connection to the piazza, and in turn, the piazza gradually steps down towards the canal. The vision was to create scale between the two levels and provide visual cues to visitors; offering a glimpse of the park while they meander along the canal edge. This was also achieved by means of various soft and hard landscaping elements such as a grand concrete staircase leading from the piazza to the park, sloping and folding walls, and plants to draw the eye to the park above.",
                    "On the elevated park level, visitors can explore landscaped gardens with trees and stone-clad planters, meandering walkways with built-in benches, a concrete skatepark, basketball court and new pedestrian routes. Throughout the park and piazza cantilevered steel pergolas scale the design and provide much- needed shade.",
                    "The lower piazza level contains 11 boutique retail units that line the splayed canal-facing walls and form an active eastern edge to the new canal pedestrian route. The intention behind the piazza was to activate the canal via a range of water sports and provide a link between the V&A and the CBD – encouraging a pedestrianised environment. Referencing the battery’s original façade, loosely packed stone-filled gabion walls shroud the parking facility and stone-clad planters contain fynbos and waterwise plants. All stone used throughout the park and piazza was excavated from the site during the construction process. These antiquated elements juxtapose contemporary insertions that reference the battery rather than replicate its heritage.",
                    "The materials palette includes a selection of hardy materials that suit the robust nature of the park, namely, concrete, stone and steel. Concrete was chosen as a “material of our time” for new structures as it can be clearly distinguished from historic elements, ensuing little misinterpretation. A precast concrete panel structure dubbed the interpretation pavilion has been built to the estimated height of the battery’s original walls and links the park, piazza and parking facility via internal elevators. To resemble cannon embrasures, three small openings form part of the structure’s canal-facing wall. Historic cannons from Amsterdam Battery found scattered throughout the V&A by the Cannon Association of South Africa and preserved for the development of the park are now on display inside the interpretation pavilion. The artefacts sit on top of precast concrete plinths, made to resemble old timber cannon carriages, allowing them to protrude through the embrasures and overlook the canal.",
                    "Partner at dhk and lead architect on the project Pierre Swanepoel says, “The intention was to facilitate a new hub of activity within the V&A district whilst being respectful to the heritage of the Amsterdam Battery, once a place of exclusion and incarceration, but now a public space designed to support and engage the greater Cape Town community”."

However, this tends to present an acoustic challenge, and with this, comes with the obvious tension between the stimulation of interaction and the need to focus – spaces must balance a sense of containment with a feeling of connectedness."

These include mobile furniture items that are quickly arranged in various ways; whether on wheels or are sufficiently light to manoeuvre. This could be storage that doubles up as seating or inviting nooks and perches to engage in a variety of different activities. Other examples are smart acoustic panels that house screens, Wi-Fi points or other technologies while doubling as colourful absorbers of sound. Increasingly, the need to move, sit, stand, and even lie down and learn, are being facilitated via bar counters, poofs, ottomans, large staircases, and cave-like nooks."

Very few schools in SA can afford to extend their current facilities to cater to this expanded and evolving curriculum. We believe that the key is to take as many opportunities as possible from the design of new schools and emulate the principles of flexible, interconnected spaces to a greater degree as possible. This means that the same set of buildings must transform to become more multi-functional; to accommodate smaller segregated groups (particularly where there are significant age gaps) while also being able to host larger gatherings and activities. Combine this with a carefully considered masterplan, which has outside spaces being equally important to their adjoining internal clusters, and we believe that it can enable as many opportunities for educators to put into practice the activities associated with blended learning (regardless of the degree of technological capacity)."

This allies well with another trend gaining further traction in the more cost-effective approach to the roll-out of schools which is the ‘Design for Manufacture and Assembly’ aspect. There are two components to this. Firstly, from a space-planning perspective, the modularity enables an adaptability which can be applied to multiple classroom instances. And secondly, the carefully considered modular method which uses standardised components making the ease of both production and assembly possible in a limited time frame."

This theme of adaptability has seen the notion of what constitutes a school transformed into a variety of different learning environments. Schools of all sizes are popping up in various places with former office buildings and warehouses being kitted out as learning spaces. Recreational activities are being reconceived, too. Climbing, functional fitness, rooftop courts and club sports are alternatives to the traditional field-based sports. This is an exciting sector to watch evolve, potentially offering multiple routes to obtaining a well-rounded education."
