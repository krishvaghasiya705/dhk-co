                    "Despite the need to navigate challenges such as international geopolitical crises, the impact of climate change, and regional conflict, East Africa remains the most buoyant region on the continent. This was the key takeaway from the East Africa Property Investment (EAPI) conference, held in Nairobi in early May. The premier property networking event in the region reconnects investors, developers and industry leaders from Africa and globally. The theme this year, Positioning for Opportunity, was apt for the summit which presented a refreshed platform for developers and investors seeking to capitalise on the East African opportunity. It was exciting to learn how East Africa is working hard to be the next main hub and how the banks, investors and developers are supporting that growth.",
                    "A 2024 report by the African Development Bank Group (ADBG) projected East Africa's growth to rise to5.7% in 2025, an increase following a forecast of 5.1% in 2024. In addition to the region’s emergence from the Covid-19 pandemic with a strong economic recovery in 2020, and its rapid economic rebound in 2021 and 2022, the report notes that “East Africa has continued to set a standard for antifragility on the continent…despite a slowdown in 2023, driven primarily by conflict in Sudan.” The report pointed to projections that the region is poised to return in 2024and 2025.",
                    "With these prospects, East Africa remains attractive for investment and development. But the question becomes, how do developers and investors position themselves for the EastAfrican opportunity."

Proven performers such as improving political stability, stabilising interest rates, and development demand in Tanzania and Zanzibar, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia support the impetus. Kenya and surrounding countries, for example, are recording GDP growth projections between 2025 and 2029 which are higher than the continent’s traditional economic powerhouse of South Africa. This reflects higher investor confidence in those countries compared with the SADC region.",
                    "The opportunity for doing business in the region exists, and is growing. The region is seen as part of the African 'circuit' alongside Cape Town's Table Mountain and food culture, the Kenyan Serengeti migrations, the Maasai Mara, Gorillas of Uganda and Rwanda and the beaches of the Seychelles. Tourism, particularly in Kenya, was cited as a growth area. In 2024, Nairobi was awarded Africa's Leading Business Travel Destination at the 2024 World Travel Awards. For designers, this presents an exciting opportunity to explore how hospitality and interior design could, and arguably, should, shape the African tourism industry."

Millennials and Gen Z, are among the influx of people moving back home after spending time abroad, bringing with them are defined sense of luxury, and desires and expectations that differ from what previous generations considered to be luxury. An important shift is the urge to preserve the environment. In this respect, the clear message to designers is the need todesign spaces that are more agile and that respond more to the melting pot of cultures living and working in the same spaces. Design can no longer be considered in isolation.",
                    "This is most seen in the need for inner city regeneration and the provision of accommodation, amenities and services for young professionals and students. This is paired with a need for additional schools and tertiary education centres as well as growth and enhancements in healthcare.",

The technology is here to stay, and we need to find a way of effectively and safely integrating it into our work. Within our own BIM team, our research and development (R&D) team is briefed to test new software and artificial intelligence (AI) technology workflows to improve how BIM is delivered, and how we deliver architectural designs. At the same time, in each scheme, our urban designers, architects and interior designers consider how to promote and facilitate human interactions. While AI could be prompted to design a building, the human nature of how people interact and use the space and surrounds cannot be digitally replicated."

These have been incredibly successful; the turnaround time has been so fast and there’s no reason to pick up the phone.

You can’t pretend you don’t use them, because everyone does, and there is so much visual material out there. What always works best is finding an object or some personal aspect relating to your client or the building you are in that has historical value. Exploring the relationship between this object and your client and turning it into something special and unique is precious. I remember finding a Nguni hairpin while working on a project many years ago. We used it to make beautiful sculptural timber screens for a client’s office. That was 15 years ago, and I think she is still there and still enjoys those screens, it’s priceless. It was in the moment and there was a bit of luck. The important thing is to see the opportunity, make the connection and own it. The challenge is also to change the fate of the object and to do it convincingly."

She concedes that a different mindset is needed as a leader of a large practice from being a sole proprietor. “When you’re running your own business, you’re the only checkpoint – which has both advantages and disadvantages,” she says.",
                    "She enjoys the strong support at dhk, which she believes also makes it easier to scale through delegation in a way that is very difficult as a sole trader.",
                    "While modernism strikes a chord with Leigh in terms of inspiration, the way she describes her approach to design matches dhk’s holistic, integrated philosophy. The shared focus on putting people at the centre of design made it a perfect match from the start.",
                    "Leigh explains: “I like to be context driven and take all the indicators into account. It’s rather the drivers of the project that determine the type of architecture. So, it’s more of a sensitive and responsive approach to design that I favour. It’s also about practicality.",
                    "“I think you need to come up with the most efficient solution, a solution that’s most responsive to the context, site and climate within which you find it, and you must be sensitive to your client’s needs in terms of budget, time constraints. They’re all outputs governed by unique characteristics of that project. That’s what drives me a lot. It’s less about bold statements and more about sensitivity and responsiveness to the needs of the project which is aligned with the practice’s general ethos.”",
                    "Leigh references <a href='httpshttps://dhk-dev.webflow.io/journal/bringing-an-old-battery-to-life' target='__blank'>Battery Park</a> as one of her favourite dhk projects that encapsulates this ethos.",
                    "She explains: “It’s essentially a parking area with a facing on it, which could have been quite mundane. It’s also a precious heritage resource that we made interventions in. I think the way it was done was handled quite sensitively. I think it’s also very successful in the way it presents itself and in the way it’s been accepted by the community. It’s a much-loved space and it’s well tenanted and used. It’s a project that has a lot more joy and beauty to it. It was handled very well.”"

                    "In April 2024, Leigh’s contributions to architecture earned her recognition on Africans Column’s list of 50 Influential African Women Architects. She was among seven other amazing South African women architects on the list and was lauded for her commitment to inspiring inclusivity and gender equality in architecture, striving to motivate and create space for future female leaders in the industry.",
                    "When asked about her impressions of how the industry has evolved in terms of gender diversity since she started her career and what changes she’d like to see, Leigh believes that the industry is gradually evolving, although it remains a male-dominated field.",
                    "“When I started there was far less gender diversity than there is now. Every year it kind of improves. You could tell with our graduating class. We were completely outnumbered in terms of men versus women and that’s obviously what’s going out into the world, but it’s still very male dominated. I would love to see it changing faster, but you’re redressing a situation that was completely out of balance before and so it takes time,” she says.",
                    "With 22 years in the industry, it’s safe to say that Leigh, who also juggles the roles of daughter, sister, wife and mother to her 15-year-old daughter, knows a thing or two about what it takes to succeed in the industry. She’s open about the demands of the profession, saying that architecture requires dedication and hard work, and the ability to not only look at the world, but to see the world beyond your own and through different eyes.",
                    "She concludes: “You have to be passionate about what you’re doing and fully invested in this career. There’s also a lot of responsibility and risk. In terms of building projects, architects are seen as the lead. We have to lead the design, coordination, packaging, presentation and on-site supervision of projects. It’s an incredibly responsible role and you have to be willing to take on that kind of responsibility. I think if it’s something you’re passionate about, it can be incredibly rewarding.",
                    "“If it’s your passion and you can see that for yourself, then success will come naturally. I also think architectural knowledge is esoteric and difficult to come by. The training at university doesn’t prepare you for real working world. You’ve got to be out there and curious and expose yourself.”"

At times, the project was a rollercoaster, with structural challenges and Covid-19 lockdowns. But it also provided valuable lessons and opportunities for creative solutions such as using fritting on glass to reduce heat and diffuse harsh light, and innovating with Wedi building boards – a product Jankel had never used before.",

It was completed in the early 1980s and sits on a private property. While at dhk, Jankel contributed on various projects, including The Rubik and 32 on Kloof.

Located at the edge of the Cape Town CBD, it is a vibrant mixed-use environment characterised by contemporary architecture standing alongside remnants of the area’s industrial, marine and archaeological past. One of the city’s oldest coastal fortification structures, the Amsterdam Battery, is located in the gateway Canal District of the V&A Waterfront. The district connects the V&A Waterfront and the CBD. In 2015, an urban design framework was developed to reinvigorate the area.",
                    "The challenge was to create a cohesive urban realm to preserve the historical landmark within a contemporary urban design solution. The historical battery stands eight metres above the canal below, and so Battery Park was the centrepoint of the framework – a 12 000m2 (1.2 hectare) publicly accessible urban park, designed to stitch the new district into the surrounding urban fabric.",

A grand concrete staircase leads to a piazza below, where retail units and water sports facilities encourage people to visit and linger. The elevated park tapers towards the piazza, and in turn, the piazza gradually steps down towards the canal, offering glimpses of both. Waterwise and indigenous fynbos plants soften the gabion walls. Stone excavated from the construction site was used throughout the design.",

                    "<a href='https://goforgold.org.za/' target='__blank'>Go for Gold</a> is an education-to-employment public-private initiative that connects participating companies with their future workforce. The award-winning initiative was founded in 1999 through collaboration between companies in the built environment, the Western Cape Department of Education and civil society. It offers students from underprivileged communities in Cape Town and Johannesburg an education development programme from Grade 10 through 12, followed by an internship year and tertiary education support. Once students graduate, they’re guaranteed employment with partner companies.",
                    "Go for Gold assists around 150 high school learners annually through its Education Development Programme. The organisation also places 40 students in internships at partner companies and helps 300 students pursue higher education at various institutions. Additionally, the programme celebrates about 40 technical graduates each year, some of whom serve as mentors to younger Go for Gold students.",
                    "Kaneasha describes her experience of the programme as an enriching one, and she’s already paying it forward. Go for Gold has enabled her to grow both in her personal capacity and as a professional. On 21 June 2024, the 25-year-old was part of a dhk team that attended the annual Go for Gold Career Jamboree held at Cape Town High School. She described the moment as heartwarming, remembering being in the same shoes as the students she met that day. She took time to share with them advice and insights about her career journey.",
                    "Reflecting on her time in the programme, she said: “I know that some people say it’s a waste of time to do an internship before studying, but for me, I felt that if it wasn’t for this experience, I probably wouldn’t have been able to survive during my studies. It’s good to get a glimpse into what exactly you’ll be getting into for the rest of your life. For me, Go for Gold has been invaluable and has moulded me into the person I am.",
                    "“I often remember how shy I was, but through the support and mentorship over the years, I have become much more confident in my abilities and as a person. I’m now in my third year of work at dhk. I feel like there are always people cheering me on, which is an amazing feeling.”",
                    "At the Go for Gold Career Jamboree, Bridget-Ann Mullins, the National Director for Go for Gold, expressed similar sentiments, emphasising the importance of exposing students not only to the variety within the built environment but also to higher education institutions.",
                    "“It’s fundamental that students from disadvantaged communities are allowed the opportunity to explore what the built environment actually means. Although we can tell them about it, being able to see it tangibly, speak to other people, see the models and link to those in the industry just creates an awareness and opens up a pathway for informed decision-making about their futures,” noted Bridget-Ann."
